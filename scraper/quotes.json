Elon Musk, the boss of Tesla, recently cut the ribbon on a fourth facility by that name, in Berlin. Tesla\u2019s Shanghai Gigafactory has been in the news for a covid-related halt in production. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (), one of the world\u2019s most important chipmakers, has begun touting its \u201cgigafabs\u201d. Nissan has announced a gigafactory in Sunderland, in the north-east of England.Giga- is a prefix meaning \u201ca billion\u201d of something. The Oxford English Dictionary drily describes it as an \u201carbitrary derivative\u201d of the Greek , \u201cgiant\u201d. (The ancient Greeks apparently had no need for a specific word for \u201cbillions\u201d.) But the various gigafactories don\u2019t always produce billions of anything: each month the  gigafab can start about 100,000 silicon wafers used for making microchips, making it more of a hectokilofactory. ( and  really are Greek for 100 and 1,000.) Tesla, at least, can claim that its original Gigafactory in Nevada supplies billions of watt-hours of battery-cell output per year.As science has expanded to the huge and the tiny, the need for new metric-system prefixes has grown accordingly. These have made their way into common parlance mostly through computing. In the 1980s a good computer might have had 256 kilobytes of memory. The first hard drives with a million bytes\u2019 worth of storage introduced the world to the megabyte, a jaw-dropping notion at the time. (, too, was generic in Greek, meaning \u201cgreat\u201d. A megalomaniac has delusions of greatness, not millionaire status.) But at least many people had heard of the mega- prefix before. When the billion-byte mark was crossed, many began encountering \u201cgiga-\u201d for the first time, strange new linguistic territory opened up by Moore\u2019s Law.It can be only a matter of time before giga- feels ho-hum; after all, a memory card with 128 gigabytes of storage is today the size of a thumbnail and costs around $20. Affordable hard drives now have terabyte\u2014that is, trillion-byte\u2014storage. Having run out of terms for \u201cbig\u201d, the borrowers from Greek got creative:  means \u201cmonster\u201d. As billions become workaday, tera- will become the new giga-.For a while, anyway. Whether or not computing power continues to grow at the rate it has in the past\u2014a matter of some debate\u2014it is inevitable that peta- and exa- will make their debut in the popular consciousness. Already selected by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (), peta- and exa- come from Greek  (five) and  (six), representing 1,000 and 1,000. After that, the \u2019s prefix-mongers have decided to go for Latin rather than Greek. They considered septa- and octo- for 1,000 and 1,000. But the proposed s- shortening of septa- could have been confused with an abbreviation for a second, and the o- for a zero. So septa- and octo- were deformed to zetta- (1,000) and yotta- (1,000).As the system of prefixes can now encompass a 1 followed by 24 zeroes, most scientists will be happy to use 10 and the like for anything bigger. But not college students: a group at the University of California, Davis, started a petition proposing a new prefix, hella-, for 10. Northern Californians will know  as an adverb, derived from , as in \u201che\u2019s hella ugly.\u201d And as a prefix, it has gained a bit of currency in the technology press, if only jokingly. It would be the first of the prefixes for huge numbers not to come from the classical languages. \u201cHell\u201d is a Germanic word.Small is cool too. The fractional equivalent of giga- is nano-, the prefix denoting a billionth. Nanotechnology is big, so to speak: nanoparticles making up nanobeads are hot topics in science and technology. The hip feel conveyed by the prefix was borrowed by Apple, which named its tiny music player the Nano. (Again, the etymology is classical:  is the Greek word for \u201cdwarf\u201d.) If nano-, too, eventually becomes humdrum, look out for pico- (a trillionth, from Spanish  for \u201ca little bit\u201d), femto- and atto-, from the Danish for 15 and 18, referring to 10 and 10.Classicists once scoffed at words, such as \u201ctelevision\u201d and \u201cmonolingual\u201d, which mix up Greek and Latin roots. Now they are obliged to behold gigafactories and decacorns (private companies that are worth over $10bn), nanoseconds and terawatts, to say nothing of hellabytes. These may seem ungainly, but the Hellenophiles can console themselves that the chimera\u2014an unlikely combination of lion, goat and snake\u2014was, after all, a Greek beast.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/culture/2022/04/09/as-the-scale-of-science-expands-so-does-the-language-of-prefixes", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T12:46:06Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220409_CUD001_0.jpg"},

More than you might think, and more than is good for the rest of humanity, writes Gideon Rachman, a columnist for the  who previously worked for . He sees all three men as proof of the advent of \u201cThe Age of the Strongman\u201d, as his wide-ranging and astute new book is titled. They present a threat not only to the well-being of their own countries, but also to a world order in which liberal, cosmopolitan ideas are increasingly embattled.It is hard to dispute the view that those three, along with the likes of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, Viktor Orban, the newly re-elected prime minister of Hungary, and Jair Bolsonaro, the president of Brazil, share certain traits. To varying degrees, they all claim to speak for the common man, while undermining institutions, stoking nationalism and cultivating a personal style of politics, if not an outright personality cult. True, Mr Johnson has not been accused of ordering the murder of any critics, as Prince Muhammad, better known as , has been in the case of Jamal Khashoggi (he denies it). But Mr Rachman argues convincingly that the strongman style is a continuum, in which its exponents\u2019 affinities are amplified or muffled by the particular political system in which each operates.It is striking to see how many contemporary leaders fit the strongman mould. What with Donald Trump and Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, all three of the world\u2019s most populous countries were led by would-be or actual strongmen until last year, by Mr Rachman\u2019s reckoning. They are present in Europe (Mr Johnson, Mr Orban and Vladimir Putin), in Africa (Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister) and Asia (Messrs Modi and Xi, plus Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines). The Middle East furnishes Mr Erdogan,  and Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s former prime minister; the Americas contribute Mr Bolsonaro and Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the president of Mexico. The roster includes royals, elected politicians and fully fledged autocrats. And they are doing huge damage.The harm is not just to the people they oppress or the national political systems that they corrode. Strongmen also chip away at global institutions, international norms and multilateral co-operation. Many are suspicious of free trade. Few are inclined to endure much inconvenience to curb climate change. They are prone to adventurism and aggression in foreign policy\u2014witness Mr Putin\u2019s murderous invasion of Ukraine.But the ongoing war there, which began after the book was written, also suggests the limits of Mr Rachman\u2019s analysis. His strongmen show little solidarity or diplomatic allegiance to one another. Some have sided with Mr Putin, others have opposed him and still others are sitting on the fence. Identifying someone as a strongman is only a partial guide to how he (the book does not mention any strongwomen) is likely to behave.Mr Rachman\u2019s most powerful point concerns not the strongmen themselves, but Western politicians\u2019 and commentators\u2019 wishful thinking about them (including, on occasion, ). When Mr Putin succeeded Boris Yeltsin, he was hailed as a man who could stabilise Russia\u2019s listing democracy. Mr Erdogan, too, was greeted with optimism, as someone who could reconcile Islam and democracy. Abiy was going to put an end to Ethiopia\u2019s ethnic divisions;  was going to drag the Saudi monarchy into the 21st century; and so on. The world\u2019s genuine democracies may not be to blame for the rise of the strongmen, but they have not been very shrewd about warding them off, either.

William Burns, the  director and a former ambassador to Jordan, recognised the threat this represented to a crucial American ally. He hotfooted it to the White House to brief Joe Biden\u2014\u201cthe first customer\u201d, in  parlance\u2014who immediately called King Abdullah to express his strong support. Once the crisis had passed, the Jordanian became the first Arab leader to visit Mr Biden.The incident, little noticed at the time, was a foretaste of the attributes Mr Burns has brought to Langley. Decisive, discreet and experienced, the 66-year-old former career diplomat\u2014often described as the most accomplished envoy of his generation\u2014combines expertise with influence. Fluent in Russian and Arabic, he has served five presidents and had two postings in Moscow: the first amid the chaos of Boris Yeltsin\u2019s leadership, the second, as ambassador, during Vladimir Putin\u2019s early tenure, as America\u2019s relations with Russia darkened. He knows the Russian leader well. And few advisers are as trusted by Mr Biden, whom the spy chief has briefed for almost three decades, including on the Iran nuclear deal, which he negotiated for Barack Obama in 2015.He has duly taken a lead role in the Ukraine crisis. After American and British spies uncovered Russia\u2019s war-planning last October, Mr Burns was dispatched to Moscow to warn Mr Putin that his intentions were clear and of the consequences they would invite. Perhaps Mr Putin, stewing in his dacha over covid-19 and his many grievances, would have spoken to no other emissary. Doubly convinced that war was likely, Mr Burns then helped lead a successful effort to convince sceptical European allies of Mr Putin\u2019s plans by making the Anglo-American intelligence on them public. Rarely has America\u2019s intelligence community, a scapegoat, rightly or wrongly, for many foreign-policy blunders over the decades, achieved such a clear win. It has been hailed as one of the most creative and successful uses of intelligence in many years.Ukraine remains a disaster, of course. Yet at a time when American foreign policy is increasingly viewed through a distorting political lens\u2014as either a great triumph or humiliating defeat\u2014the administration\u2019s response to the crisis is a reminder that clever diplomacy usually produces something in between. Diplomacy is an exercise, in Henry Kissinger\u2019s careful phrase, which Mr Burns quotes admiringly, in \u201cthe patient accumulation of partial successes\u201d. In the spy chief\u2019s own contribution to that painstaking task, three qualities stand out.One is the indispensability of deep subject knowledge. Most recent foreign-policy blunders\u2014from the abrogation of the Iran deal by Donald Trump to George W. Bush\u2019s invasion of Iraq\u2014were made in profound ignorance of the world that America was presuming to shape. Mr Burns\u2019s views on Russia, by contrast, are informed by a deep appreciation of it as well as understanding. As ambassador, he discussed Russian spirituality with Alexander Solzhenitsyn, was grilled by the Duma foreign-affairs committee, spoke at the funeral of a journalist murdered on Mr Putin\u2019s birthday and travelled the Russian land mass relentlessly. A one-man repository of America\u2019s institutional knowledge of Russia, Mr Burns represents a tradition of serious American diplomacy that has been under appreciated by American policymakers. \u201cThere is simply no one who knows Russia better,\u201d says Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser. It is no coincidence that one of Mr Burns\u2019s first actions at the  was to launch a drive to recruit more Mandarin-speakers. He recognises that America, no longer the world\u2019s policeman, cannot hope to shape a world it does not understand.Another Burns attribute is his institutionalism. On Mr Trump\u2019s first day in office the president delivered an unhinged speech to America\u2019s spies while standing by the Memorial Wall in Langley that lists the  members who have died in service. He also ignored the intelligence briefings the agency prepared for him. Even if his spy chiefs, Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel, had been more competent and likeable they could not have prevented the demoralisation and attrition this caused. Mr Burns\u2019s effort to fix the damage has involved repurposing as well as reassuring the .He has launched two new mission-centres, one covering China and the other technology and transnational threats such as climate change. The second, which is dedicated in part to keeping abreast of technological developments in the private sector, illustrates how rapid socioeconomic change is forcing intelligence agencies to expand into areas beyond espionage. The administration\u2019s creative use of the intelligence on Ukraine is another example of that: it was informed by a desire to cut through the chaos of open-source intelligence reports as well as by fear of Russian disinformation. Agency sources point to internal contentment with that policy, notwithstanding the \u2019s customary obsession with secrecy, as proof of its confidence in Mr Burns.The third quality is collegiality, which is a common feature of Mr Biden\u2019s foreign-policy team. Mr Sullivan and Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, seem similarly unencumbered by the petty jealousies that usually plague the cabinet. Mr Burns\u2019s current prominence, including in roles that Mr Blinken might have been expected to perform, appears to have ruffled no feathers among his peers. It helps that he and they have worked together for years.They also all appear to enjoy Mr Biden\u2019s trust. Perhaps not since William Casey, Ronald Reagan\u2019s spy chief, has a  director enjoyed such easy access to the president as the current one enjoys. The only significant criticism Mr Burns faces (which his memoir suggests he shares) is that it is in his careerist nature to be too accommodating to power. No one accuses Mr Burns of being egocentric. At a bleak time, Mr Biden is lucky to have him to hand.

It helps if she is wily, or rich, or lives in a neighbourhood that caters to foreigners.Persuading the family is usually the first hurdle. Arguing simply for freedom would be valiant but often unwise. Better to cite the bad traffic as your reason. That helped convince Layla\u2019s mother, because they both tend to be car sick. Having her own flat would shorten her commute.Finding an amenable landlord can be awkward, too. Few let to single women, since that may damage the building\u2019s reputation or ruffle its other residents\u2019 moral feathers. Some let on condition that a lone woman must have no visitors.Once an unmarried woman clinches a rental deal, she must often fend off nosy neighbours and doormen, says Basmalah, another singleton, who also spoke under a false name. Boyfriends sometimes have to sneak in when the doorman is on a coffee break. Hers took the stairs, since the lift would give away the floor he was stopping at. Luckily one of her doormen mistook her for a foreigner: she did not disabuse him. They tend to wink at those loose-living Westerners.Some women simply fork out for freedom. Landlords in affluent neighbourhoods are often more liberal. Bribing the doorman may be the way to keep him out of your hair. Paying for your own furniture can help, too. Egyptian police routinely question people living in rented flats in big cities. They keep a closer eye on furnished ones, says Layla, since journalists, political activists, foreigners and people selling sex are too transient to have their own furniture. Layla lugs around a futon: it buys a bit of privacy.Single Egyptian women often help each other navigate their country\u2019s mores. They have been known to have money sent to a stranger through social-media groups if she gets kicked out of her place and needs a hotel room. When a woman leaves a flat that permits singles, she may make sure that a friend is next in line. Basmalah knows the names of all the women who lived in her flat for the previous ten years.

Research by Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University suggests that, on average, employees reckon the blend of in-person and remote work is a perk equivalent to an 8% pay increase. The biggest attraction of days spent working from home is the absence of a commute. Other benefits include not having to get ready for the office: the proportion of people wearing a fresh set of clothes drops by 20 percentage points when they are not commuting.Executives have been keener to get people back into the office full-time, so that employees can bond with peers, absorb the corporate culture and appreciate the awesome power of laundry. But even sceptics have accepted that hybrid working will be part of the post-pandemic future: in his annual letter to shareholders this week, Jamie Dimon, the boss of JPMorgan Chase, said he thought that about 40% of the bank\u2019s staff would be hybrid. The job now is to make sure that hybridisation works as well as it can for both employees and employers. That depends on one ingredient above all: clarity. Things function best when everyone knows what is expected.Start with the shape of the hybrid week. One of the great theoretical attractions of hybrid working to employees is that they get to choose what days they come in. But the point of in-person working is to spend time collaborating and bonding with their colleagues: that is much more likely to happen if companies are clear about who they want in the office on which days of the week.Clarity also maximises the benefits of work-from-home days. If office time is best spent in a whirlwind of collaborative brainstorming and socialising, home days are logically the time when solo and focused work should get done. That requires bosses to do what comes unnaturally to them, by resisting the temptation to interrupt at will.It is easier to do that if expectations are clear. Anne Raimondi of Asana, a work-management platform, says the firm expects people to come in on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and has a \u201cno meetings\u201d day on Wednesday. If a manager wants to have a meeting that day, they have to \u201crecontract\u201d with their team and explain why it is needed.By the same token, being explicit when a reply is needed on an email saves everyone scurrying around in a desperate bid to answer the boss first. Defining what kinds of work can be done asynchronously and what requires everyone to get together is a recipe for fewer, better meetings. Encouraging a set of do-not-disturb protocols makes it less likely that employees will be bothered unnecessarily.Clear protocols also make hybrid meetings go better. Harry\u2019s, a shaving firm that has published its guidelines for hybrid working, expects each attendee to have their own screen and promises not to keep discussing the matter at hand once remote colleagues have left the meeting (though commenting on who is wearing the same clothes as they did yesterday is presumably fine).Some of this will be deeply alarming to managers who worry about slippery slopes. First you give people space to focus at home, and soon enough you cannot contact anyone because they have changed their settings on Slack and are binge-watching \u201cBridgerton\u201d.There are three answers to such worries. First, expectations are firmly in the gift of managers. Asana\u2019s no-meetings day does not extend to meetings with customers, for example.Second, burnout is as much of a risk as slacking. New research from Microsoft finds evidence for what it calls a \u201ctriple-peak day\u201d. As well as the usual large crests in activity in the early morning and after lunch, around 30% of employees at the tech giant also experience a smaller, third bump in work in the late evening. That may be a sign of people getting work done when it suits them\u2014or of the workday extending relentlessly into every waking hour. Setting expectations, over things like how quickly notifications need to get a response, can help determine which one it is.Last, good performance is not defined by employees\u2019 locations at specific times of the day but by what they achieve\u2014what Mr Bloom calls \u201cmanaging outputs, not inputs\u201d. If bosses can articulate what counts as productive activity, and evaluate it regularly, it matters less whether employees are at headquarters or stinking out the spare bedroom. Managers may have concerns about hybrid working, but it is pretty clear what will make it successful.:", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/how-to-make-hybrid-work-a-success", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T13:29:39Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220409_WBD001_1.jpg"},
{"title": "No-fault divorce begins this week in England and Wales", "content": "THOSE WHOM God has joined together, let no one put asunder. Or so the resonant words of the Church of England\u2019s marriage ceremony have it. The laws of England, however, have typically taken a more moderate approach. For the past 150-odd years they have been footnoting that fine phrase with occasions when a little sundering might be suitable after all.In 1857, for example, English law started to allow divorce on the grounds of adultery, sodomy, rape and (unarguably, if unexpectedly) bestiality. From 1969, the law accepted \u201cbehaviour\u201d as another reason, a category largely intended to cover intolerable behaviour and abuse\u2014but one which rapidly expanded. To date English law has accepted as unreasonable behaviour not just abuse but also making \u201cshepherd\u2019s pie too often\u201d, \u201cnot stacking the dishwasher properly\u201d and (naturally) \u201cnoisy eating\u201d.What English law has never allowed is for a divorce to take place simply because a couple wishes it to. That changes this week. From April 6th, it will be possible to divorce swiftly in England and Wales without one spouse being at fault. Practically, the change is simple: until now, if you wished to divorce you would have had to pay \u00a3593 ($780), fill in the form and tick one of five boxes, such as \u201cBehaviour\u201d or \u201cAdultery\u201d, for the reason, and then give details. From this week you still have to fork out \u00a3593 (state monopolies, even digitised, rarely come cheap). But now you will merely tick one box stating, with Hemingwayesque simplicity, that: \u201cI confirm that my marriage or civil partnership has broken down irretrievably.\u201d It is, says Nigel Shepherd, a family lawyer and campaigner for the change, \u201ca long-overdue reform\u201d.One measure of any reform\u2019s ripeness is the extent to which most people assume that it has happened already. Boris Johnson wrote in 2012 that he had been \u201cflummoxed\u201d when asked whether he supported gay marriage because \u201cI thought it was already legal\u201d (it became so two years later). Similarly, most people might assume it has long been possible to divorce promptly in England without resorting to blame. Instead, for the past half-century, many divorcing couples who wished to end their marriages swiftly found themselves compelled to, as one put it, \u201cwildly vomit bile onto a page and click \u2018submit\u2019\u201d. The reasons why England\u2019s marital blame game persisted for so long range from legal fudges to religious opposition and moral disapproval. The reason it is changing is because Britain has. More people are more accepting of divorce than ever before. Although absolute numbers of splits are decreasing, largely because marriages are (in 2020 there were 103,500 divorces, compared with a peak of 165,000 in 1993), ease with the idea of divorce is rising. In 2018 British people were almost half as likely to disapprove of parents with young children divorcing as they were a decade earlier. Institutionalised stigma has all gone. As Daniel Monk, a law professor, points out in \u201cFifty Years of the Divorce Reform Act 1969\u201d, divorced people were refused entry to the Royal Enclosure at Ascot until 1955. Now many of those found in that Enclosure\u2014including the first in line to the throne\u2014are themselves divorced. Indeed, few families offer a finer potted history of English divorce than the royal one. It was easier for Henry VIII to separate England from the Catholic Church, and his spouse\u2019s head from her neck, than himself from his wives. By the time Edward VIII acceded to the throne in 1936, divorce had become legally easier\u2014but remained socially costly. When Edward informed the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, that he intended to marry the divorced Wallis Simpson, Baldwin pointed out that this was impossible. Today, not only is Prince Charles divorced, he is married to a divorced woman. Increasing social acceptance did not immediately lead to increasing legal simplicity. Divorce and absurdity have been joined together for decades as a result. In the 1930s \u201chotel divorces\u201d, in which an \u201cadulterous\u201d husband would hire a hotel room (Brighton was popular), a girl and a photographer, in order to be framed in an act of apparent infidelity, were so common that they were satirised by Evelyn Waugh. Today, \u201cunreasonable behaviour\u201d, once expected to be a minor cause of divorce, is the commonest reason: in 2019 it was cited by 47% of wives and 34% of husbands. Whether or not the behaviour involved truly is \u201cunreasonable\u201d is rarely scrutinised: divorce petitions are at least 14 pages long and legal advisers (who can deal with up to 70 a day) have only a few minutes to read each one. Until now, says Mr Shepherd, it was \u201ca game you have to play\u201d. And not a very amusing one, says Sandra Davis, a specialist in family law at Mishcon de Reya, a law firm, who has represented Princess Diana and Jerry Hall, among others. Although citing unreasonable behaviour can make for interesting cases (she recalls one wife who poured the contents of her husband\u2019s wine cellar down the toilet, and another who immolated her partner\u2019s prized matchbox collection) she does not think it is helpful. \u201cNo one takes divorce lightly,\u201d she says. \u201cAs night follows day, by requiring blame you build in acrimony.\u201d (Though acrimony will not be absent: some worry that speedier divorces may lead to less time for sharing assets fairly.) The blame game did the legal system few favours. Justice might be blind, but she dislikes seeming foolish. Once, the farce of hotel divorces was embarrassing enough to prompt legal change; now, the ludicrousness of citing shepherd\u2019s pie is helping to prompt more change. From 10am on April 6th it will be possible to divorce without blaming people. And the law will look a little less of an ass.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/no-fault-divorce-begins-this-week-in-england-and-wales/21808578", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T12:51:05Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_brd001.jpg"},
{"title": "Letters to the editor", "content": "\u2019s explainer on \u201c\u201d (March 30th) neglected to mention Florida\u2019s history of removing queer people from classrooms. Between 1956 and 1965, Charley Johns, a member of the Florida state Senate and a former governor, oversaw an investigation \u201cto understand and effectively deal with the growing problem of homosexuality\u201d in Florida\u2019s schools. The resulting and definitely not-safe-for-work report was chillingly titled \u201cHomosexuality and Citizenship in Florida\u201d.The Johns Committee, as it was colloquially known, worked with local police to forcibly remove students and educators suspected of being anything but straight. Suspects were pressed to out themselves and forced out of Florida\u2019s academic institutions. Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d act, signed into law recently by Ron DeSantis, is just the latest attempt to scrub the existence of queer people from educational settings.As the Ukrainian people are bombed, driven from their homes, and forced to live without heat or food, Hollywood fusses over a beautiful woman in a ballgown, miffed at having been likened to an equally beautiful star from a movie that is 25 years old (\u201c\u201d, digital editions, March 28th). Said beautiful woman\u2019s husband takes it upon himself to smack around the comedian who made the comparison, then wins the Oscar for best actor, gives a tearful speech, and basks in a standing ovation from the room. The next day he offers an apology that reads as if it has been written by a roomful of publicists and lawyers. No wonder they call it La La Land.\u201c\u201d (March 12th) reviewed \u201cButler to the World\u201d, Oliver Bullough\u2019s new book on Russian money in the British capital. Although it is obviously a topical tome for these blighted times, the review was nevertheless bereft of one key detail: the Conservative Party\u2019s insatiable love of Russian oligarchs\u2019 cash. Like a three-legged chair, the review toppled over rather spectacularly by omitting the role that the Tory party has played during its long tenure in government in courting, cuddling and suckling at the breast of hundreds of Russian oligarchs.Boris Johnson and David Cameron do appear briefly, but the wholesale shovelling of crooked cash into Britain under the sole tutelage of the Conservatives for the past decade is somehow absent. The reviewer calls for a \u201cchange of philosophy\u201d to rectify such embrace of criminality. But whose philosophy exactly? Yours? Mine?Without the Falklands war British politics could have taken an even more dramatic turn than you describe (\u201c\u201d, April 2nd). Polling day for the Beaconsfield parliamentary by-election took place on May 27th 1982, as a British victory in the war came in sight. The Conservative campaign featured a personal appeal from Margaret Thatcher to \u201csupport our troops\u201d, with its party agent pictured in second-world-war battle dress.Unsurprisingly, the Liberal/  Alliance candidate (me) only achieved a respectable second place, although relegating the Labour nominee (one Anthony Blair) to third. Had this previously very true blue seat followed the pattern of Croydon, Crosby and Hillhead with an Alliance victory, then it is a reasonable assumption that the Alliance would have out-polled Labour in the general election of 1983. Would that not have broken the mould of two-party politics?\u2019s nose for weather is as keen as ever. The recent flurry of activity that closed American schools for \u201csnow days\u201d is an early gust from a much larger storm brewing in primary education (\u201c\u201d, March 19th). Weather-related emergency school closures are becoming unbearably frequent. The best data come from California, where the number of schools that closed for weather rose 800% from 2016 to 2019. Anecdotally, school closures due to fires, floods, mud, heat, storms and snow are on the rise across the whole country (a high school was destroyed recently by a tornado in Jacksboro, Texas).Remote learning, which many saw as a temporary pandemic measure, is the best tool available to mitigate the effects of climate change on education. Now is the time for communities to permanently adopt a remote-resilient digital curriculum and prepare for a future when a significant fraction of learning happens remotely. Under the surface, that is what New York\u2019s snow-day plan is all about.PresidentWork on LearningThe Daily Chart on \u201c\u201d (March 31st) stated that the one-year forward exchange-rate for the Russian currency is a measure of the market\u2019s expected exchange rate, given the interest-rate differential between Russia and America. This is not strictly incorrect, but it is slightly misleading.The forward exchange-rate is purely a reflection of the interest-rate differential, based on the current spot rate. It is an arbitrage value and not a market prediction in itself. All expectations of the future value of a currency are priced into the spot rate.International Capital Market Associationchastised the European public for \u201cliving as if nothing were amiss\u201d during the energy crisis and war in Ukraine, and urged us to do things like turning down the thermostat to help save fuel (March 26th). Actually in Portugal, many deaths during the winter months are related to low temperatures in homes. Charlemagne made a comparison with the energy crisis of the 1970s. But times have changed since then, even if Europeans are today living with higher fuel prices and raging inflation.This is an era of austerity economics, coupled with a pandemic that has especially affected Europe\u2019s young adults. We face unemployment, stagnant salaries, surging food costs and soaring rents. To suggest that we aren\u2019t sacrificing anything is uncalled for. The behaviour of Europeans is not a cause of shame. We are doing a lot; and note the generous European response to Ukrainian refugees.Regarding Britain\u2019s dismal chilly weather and the Roman bathhouses that tried to make Roman Britain bearable (\u201c\u201d, March 19th).

Now it boasts a blackboard, a bright carpet decorated with cartoon animals, and desks at which a dozen small children are learning to write. Her pupils are  who have arrived in Poland since Russia invaded their country on February 24th.

Now it boasts a blackboard, a bright carpet decorated with cartoon animals, and desks at which a dozen small children are learning to write. Her pupils are  who have arrived in Poland since Russia invaded their country on February 24th. She is a newcomer herself, having fled western Ukraine with her own two children not long after the bombs began to fall.Ms Bodar is a teacher at Materynka, a school that teaches the Ukrainian curriculum from several makeshift locations in Poland\u2019s capital. Before the war began it had about 200 pupils, largely children of migrants who had come to Warsaw to work. Now it has around 1,000. Larysa Vychivska, one of its founders, points to a tall stack of forms filled out by newcomers. She says her school is taking in about 20 new pupils each day.At least a quarter of Ukraine\u2019s 7.5m children have  started in February. They need not only food and shelter but brain food, too. Providing classes is a particular challenge for Poland, over whose border more than half of  have fled. So far more than 160,000 have registered to attend local schools. Przemyslaw Czarnek, the education minister, has warned that Poland could eventually have to find room for 700,000 new pupils. That would mean expanding its school system by 14%.At Janusz Korczak Primary, a school in the Warsaw district of Mokotow (pictured), almost every class has new pupils. Some have as many as six. Poland\u2019s government has raised caps that usually limit the size of classes. Staff are pleased to be helping. But no one thinks it is ideal to be plonking the new arrivals straight into normal lessons, when few speak much Polish. Some teachers have been asking Ukrainian children who were already enrolled before the crisis to help them communicate with newcomers. Others use Google Translate.The latest hope is that newcomers can be schooled separately in mixed-age \u201cpreparatory classes\u201d, where they can receive lessons that better match their needs. Magdalena Berucka runs one of the few primary schools in Warsaw that was offering such classes to migrant children before the conflict started. The number of children at her school has swelled by 10% since February; she has added two new preparatory classes, but says she is now short of staff and space. Schools that have never experimented with these classes will have an even harder time setting them up in a hurry.In theory online learning could take some of the strain. Teenagers coming to the end of their school years do not see much value in joining foreign schools. Those coming from parts of Ukraine that are least affected by the conflict can sometimes access remote classes being provided by their old teachers. The Ukrainian government is promoting a library of online lessons. But many pupils feel conflicted, says Tetiana Ouerghi, a teacher in Warsaw. By day they study in Polish classrooms. By night they find ways to keep up with the Ukrainian curriculum, in the hope that they will soon be going home.If all this is messy, Ukraine\u2019s  are getting more help than is commonly offered elsewhere in the world. Last year the UN guessed that only about half of all children who had fled across an international border were getting lessons of any kind. Among children old enough to attend secondary school, only one-third were attending classes (in Pakistan, which hosts 1.4m Afghan refugees, the figure is 5%). Lost years of schooling damage youngsters\u2019 prospects long after the turmoil they fled from has ended.Countries that receive lots of refugees are most often poor ones that struggle to provide good lessons even to their own children. And refugees do not themselves always think that schooling is a priority. During the first months of a crisis many assume that their return journey is just around the corner. That is rarely true: half the world\u2019s refugees have been in exile five years or longer, according to the World Bank.Setting up new systems for schooling is best done right at the start of a crisis, before global attention and funding has started to wane. But in recent years only about 3% of humanitarian aid has gone towards education. Yasmine Sherif of Education Cannot Wait, a un fund that supports schooling in emergencies, hopes that the . She says many more schoolchildren should benefit from the \u201cboldness and speed\u201d with which some governments and donors have set about helping Ukraine.No one can say how long Poland\u2019s new pupils will stay. Before the war Valentyna Mundur was a school teacher in , a Ukrainian city under Russian siege. Now she is working in Warsaw for Poland\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, helping to identify other newcomers with experience in schools. She says a Ukrainian victory is not the only thing needed before she and her son can go home. Her city will need rebuilding. She worries that all the guns and explosives now circulating in Ukraine will make it less safe than it was before.Poland\u2019s teachers hope things will get easier after the summer break, by which time more Ukrainians will probably be working in classrooms as assistants. So far, Polish parents have been supportive of the new arrivals. Visitors to Materynka must swerve around stacks of printer paper donated by well-wishers. Ms Vychivska, its co-founder, says she used to spend much of her time seeking out such gifts. \u201cNow people call up and ask me, \u2018What do you need?\u2019\u201d", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/04/how-polish-schools-are-coping-with-an-influx-of-ukrainian-children", "date_modified": "2022-04-08T12:38:09Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_eup505.jpg"},
{"title": "France looks likely to re-elect Emmanuel Macron", "content": "ON APRIL 6TH 2016 a 38-year-old former investment banker who, two years before, had been appointed as a minister in France\u2019s Socialist government announced that he wanted to change French politics. Standing in front of an audience in his home town of Amiens he declared that the old divisions between left and right were not relevant to 21st-century challenges. Matters such as climate change, or Europe, split the established mainstream parties as much as they held them together. It was time for a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d that would be \u201cneither on the left nor the right\u201d. 2016 a 38-year-old former investment banker who, two years before, had been appointed as a minister in France\u2019s Socialist government announced that he wanted to change French politics. Standing in front of an audience in his home town of Amiens he declared that the old divisions between left and right were not relevant to 21st-century challenges. Matters such as climate change, or Europe, split the established mainstream parties as much as they held them together. It was time for a \u201cpolitical movement\u201d that would be \u201cneither on the left nor the right\u201d.The event was the talk of France\u2019s political classes. But maybe only the man on the stage believed that the movement he was starting would go as far as it has. \u201cAt the time we didn\u2019t even know if Emmanuel Macron would run for the presidency,\u201d recalls Brigitte Four\u00e9, the mayor of Amiens.In May 2017 Mr Macron won his first ever elected office, leaving the established Gaullist and Socialist parties in his wake and squarely defeating Marine Le Pen of the National Front to become president of the republic. That June his movement, \u201cLa R\u00e9publique en Marche\u201d, took 53% of the seats in the National Assembly. Mr Macron had a legislature at his command.By occupying a broad centrist space, and borrowing talent from both the Socialist Party and the Republicans, Mr Macron has accomplished much in the five years since then. As he returns to the polls\u2014the first round of the presidential election is on April 10th, with the two candidates who get the most votes then pitted against each other in a run-off two weeks later\u2014he has a lead that most other heads of large democracies could only dream of. He looks likely to be the first French president to win re-election while enjoying a majority in parliament since Charles de Gaulle in 1965. But the elections also show the troubling side of the  in which Mr Macron upended the party system: the resilience of the extremes.One of the remarkable things about 2017 was that the two mainstream parties managed just 26% of the first-round vote between them, with neither making it into the second round. They will fare even worse this time. As of April 6th, \u2019s poll of polls suggested that Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, from the centre-right Republicans, and the Socialists\u2019 Anne Hidalgo would together secure a mere 11% of the vote. The three leading radical populists\u2014Ms Le Pen and Eric Zemmour on the right, and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the left\u2014will dwarf this figure with a combined 46%. Add in small fry on the fringes and those telling pollsters they will vote for candidates beyond the historic mainstream make up 54% of the electorate.Mr Macron\u2019s victory in 2017 was in part due to the extremists' success keeping the mainstream out of the second round. In a head-to-head race he trounced the hard-right Ms Le Pen. With Britain having chosen Brexit the year before, and America having put Donald Trump in the White House, this triumph by a charismatic if untested standard-bearer for broadly liberal, internationalist centrism was heralded as a setback for populism of global import.With the Gaullists and Socialists still nowhere, there is a 90% chance that this election\u2019s second round will be a re-run of 2017\u2019s. Its result, though, looks like being a great deal closer: the number of people willing to shift their allegiance to Ms Le Pen from other candidates is much higher than it was. No poll of second-round voting intentions has as yet shown Ms Le Pen as the winner. But our poll of polls puts the likely result at 53% to 47%. In many systems that would be a landslide. Compared with 66% to 34% last time it looks worryingly close. At this stage in 2017 our statistical model of the election gave Ms Le Pen a 1% chance of overall victory. On April 6th this year the equivalent number was 21% (see chart 1).By the standards of his recent predecessors, Mr Macron\u2019s first mandate must be seen as something of a success (see chart 2). A form of pragmatic, post-partisan policymaking has pushed through a range of reforms\u2014lower taxes, a more flexible labour market, better training and early education,  for gay women, and more. Parliamentary politics has become more consensual. There has been scarcely a whiff of rebellion in parliament. It feels quite normal to see Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s long-serving finance minister and once a presidential primary candidate for the Republicans, working closely alongside Olivier Dussopt, the budget minister, previously a Socialist deputy. Such harmony has made possible, among other things, a post-covid recovery plan that saw France\u2019s economy recover to pre-pandemic levels faster than any other  country apart from America.Some of the fruits of his tenure are easily seen in Mr Macron\u2019s native Amiens, a modest northern city of red-brick houses nestled in what were once the battlefields of the Somme, their soil and memories the strongest of all cases for European unity. Unemployment has fallen. Nursery education is now compulsory (and free) for all from the age of three, as it is across the country. In poorer neighbourhoods, early-primary class sizes have been halved and free breakfasts brought in as part of Mr Macron\u2019s promise to tackle inequality with better education.New businesses have opened their doors, and some existing ones have expanded. Amazon has built a distribution centre on the city\u2019s outskirts, employing over 1,000 people. A tyre plant has expanded; so has one making laundry products. \u201cOver the past five years, economic activity has really developed in Amiens,\u201d enthuses Ms Four\u00e9, the mayor, despite being a supporter of Mr Macron\u2019s presidential rival, Mrs P\u00e9cresse. A startup called Ynsect, which breeds and processes insects for animal feed and fertiliser, is building the world\u2019s biggest vertical mealworm farm. \u201cThis government has been particularly pro-business,\u201d says Antoine Hubert, Ynsect\u2019s boss. \u201cThe number and size of startups in recent years has exploded.\u201dBut there have been close-downs, too. One of the iconic moments of the 2017 campaign was when Mr Macron faced enraged trade unionists burning tyres outside a Whirlpool factory in Amiens; the firm was shipping work out to lower-cost economies elsewhere in the  and the factory faced closure. The presidential hopeful spent nearly an hour urging them not to believe the \u201cempty promises\u201d offered by the likes of Ms Le Pen, who vowed to stop the factory from closing. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you I\u2019m going to save your jobs,\u201d Mr Macron declared candidly. But he would try.Today weeds are growing in the car park of the Whirlpool factory; a sculpture made from 18 steel tumble-dryer drums dominates its deserted entrance hall. Twice new owners promised to keep the plant going. Twice they failed. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chantrelle, a former union representative. Less than half of the 280 former employees have found another permanent job. Other industrial workplaces have suffered similar fates. Work in distribution warehouses has not replaced the muscular camaraderie of the factory floor. \u201cSocially, the closure has destroyed a lot of people,\u201d says Mr Chantrelle angrily: \u201cWe can\u2019t say that Macron as a guy from Amiens has exactly been a lucky charm.\u201dDisillusion among blue-collar and low-paid workers is one of the reasons the populist vote has not gone away. The single most popular choice for blue-collar voters is Ms Le Pen: 36% say they will back her in the first round, next to 20% for Mr Macron and 19% for Mr M\u00e9lenchon, according to Ifop, a polling group. She attracts 28% of the vote of those with incomes below \u20ac970 ($1,055) a month, next to 25% for Mr Macron and 21% for Mr M\u00e9lenchon.Discontented working-class voters are hardly a novelty; for the first eleven years of Mr Macron\u2019s life the Communist Party ran Amiens town hall. Part of Ms Le Pen\u2019s success has been attracting more of them to a party which, when her father founded it in the 1970s, was based on xenophobia, anti-Semitism and nationalist nostalgia linked to the loss of French Algeria.Ms Le Pen has distanced herself from some of that heritage, not least when she changed the party\u2019s name from the National Front to the National Rally in 2018. Mr Zemmour, a former  pundit, has embraced its most reactionary and xenophobic elements. He promises to \u201csave France\u201d from the \u201cgreat replacement\u201d of its population by foreigners and Islam; he has been convicted of incitement to racial hatred. At one point he edged ahead of Ms Le Pen in the polls, but as a devotee of Vladimir Putin he was knocked back badly by the invasion of Ukraine. (Ms Le Pen and Mr M\u00e9lenchon have also had nice things to say about Mr Putin, but voters have so far minded less, if at all). A large majority of his supporters will probably transfer their allegiance to Ms Le Pen in the second round.That is hardly surprising. More untoward is the evidence that she will pick up votes from the left and the centre in unprecedented numbers. According to Ipsos, in 2017, 7% of those who had supported Mr M\u00e9lenchon and 20% of those who supported the centre-right candidate in the first round transferred their allegiance to Ms Le Pen in the second. This time polls put the numbers saying they will do so at 17% and 34% respectively. Many left-wingers, including 48% of the Green vote and 49% of Mr M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s, will abstain or spoil their ballot papers rather than support Mr Macron against her.No longer seeming beyond the pale is Ms Le Pen\u2019s great success. Some of it is cosmetic; changing the name of a party hardly changes its essence (though there have been some expulsions). As Gilles Finchelstein and Rapha\u00ebl Llorca note in a study for the Fondation Jean-Jaur\u00e8s, a think-tank, Ms Le Pen\u2019s written programme is still focused on immigration, \u201cIslamism\u201d, and \u201cnational preference\u201d for the French. The fact that Mr Zemmour makes the running on such matters, though, allows her to speak about them less, and to seem more moderate in the process.She has, on the face of it, moderated her stance on the . She no longer talks of abandoning the euro. But her vision of Europe is a long way from Mr Macron\u2019s. She looks for inspiration not to its centre, but to its edge, in the form of Hungary\u2019s \u201cilliberal democrat\u201d Viktor Orban, a thorn in Brussels\u2019 side (see Europe section). After Mr Orban was re-elected on April 3rd Ms Le Pen tweeted a photo of herself beaming alongside him and the message: \u201cWhen the people vote, the people win!\u201d She calls Mr Macron \u201cthe president of chaos\u201d.By concentrating on the cost of living, pictures with her many cats on social media and a nationalist promise to restore order as a \u201cpresident of French unity\u201d, Ms Le Pen is offering an improbably calming appeal. She has positioned herself as a leader close to the people and their concerns\u2014something Mr Macron has never managed.Rural voters respond to this positioning well, with 32% saying they will back her in the first round, compared with 12% in the Paris region. Fine-grained analysis of last time\u2019s results in south-west France by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, a political analyst, shows that her vote was particularly strong in former agricultural communes, places where vineyards have given way to new housing estates and out-of-town shopping centres. They are places where concerns about identity, globalisation and change are easily played to, and Ms Le Pen is campaigning there accordingly.In \u201cR\u00e9volution\u201d, a book he published as a candidate in 2016, Mr Macron himself warned about the danger of neglecting this \u201cperipheral France\u201d. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pull ourselves together\u201d, he wrote, \u201cin five years or in ten years the National Front will be in power.\u201d But on taking power he ignored his own warning.In 2018 it was in this car-dependent semi-rural France, where McDonald\u2019s drive-throughs sit next to newly built roundabouts decked out with kitsch sculpture, that people first put on high-visibility jackets\u2014 \u2014to complain about the way in which an increase in carbon taxation had pushed up the price of motor fuel. Their protests spread throughout the country. As French uprisings always do, they evoked echoes of 1968, 1848 and 1789. The government backed down.It was the low-point of Mr Macron\u2019s presidency and a wake-up call. He has since tried to put aside his imperious governing style and show that he can connect with ordinary people. But nothing he has done has provided a lasting bridge for the gap between him and them. He has never really shaken off his image as the \u201cpresident of the rich\u201d and embodiment of the Parisian elite.His policies, though, belie that image. By introducing a flat tax of 30% on investment income and ending the wealth tax in favour of a lighter \u201cmansion tax\u201d, he has indeed helped the rich. But France is no outlier when it comes to poverty or inequality of the sort that might explain an unusually high protest vote. Jobs are not just more plentiful; an expansion of apprenticeships and training schemes is helping more young people into work. During the pandemic Mr Macron vowed to spend \u201cwhatever it costs\u201d to keep businesses going and people in jobs, and he did, pushing the level of public spending up from 55% to 59% of  in 2021. To some extent, though, the reward for success is to have it taken for granted. Unemployment was the voters\u2019 third biggest worry in 2017. Now it does not make the top ten.Instead, they worry about the cost of living, where Ms Le Pen is focusing her efforts. Mr Macron, who since 2018 has known better than most the political risk of rising fuel costs, has subsidised petrol prices and capped energy-price hikes. Ms Le Pen goes further, promising to cut  on petrol and energy bills to 5.5%, to lower motorway tolls and, for good measure, to bring back the wealth tax. Some former supporters are aghast at how left-wing her programme is.A centre-right or centre-left party might easily do much the same. But such has been Mr Macron\u2019s success at building a broad centrist church, and so poor have been the legacy parties' efforts to re-establish themselves, that there is no strong, credible moderate opposition available. Mr Macron\u2019s vision of a realignment to bring together progressive pro-European centrists from the old left and right in order to beat conservatives and nationalists of all sorts has ended up legitimising the populist politics he promised to fight as the only opposition left.On April 2nd the Macron campaign held a glitzy rally in a packed indoor sports arena in La D\u00e9fense, west of Paris. In front of a crowd waving  flags as well as French ones, Mr Macron warned that \u201cthe extremist danger today is even greater than it was a few months ago, a few years ago\u201d and that his victory was not guaranteed. Playing to fear, rather than hope, is not his strong suit. But as Roland Lescure, a deputy in Mr Macron\u2019s campaign team, points out, \u201cPandemics and war don\u2019t lend themselves easily to optimistic politics.\u201dFor all his faults, Mr Macron remains an energetic, serious, ideas-driven leader with a knack of defying expectations. \u201cThe way he managed the pandemic was better than we could have expected,\u201d says Cindy, an amateur marathon runner from Montpellier who did not vote for him in 2017 but went to his rally in La D\u00e9fense. Rasmane Sawadogo, an accountant from Lille who also travelled to Paris for the rally, points approvingly to Mr Macron\u2019s \u201cenergy, clairvoyance and pragmatism\u201d over matters such as Europe and nuclear power.The lines on his face and grey in his hair speak of the crises Mr Macron has faced in the presidency. The less haughty tone he has begun to adopt hints at lessons learned from past mistakes. His campaign\u2019s slogans are \u201cAvec vous\u201d (\u201cWith you\u201d) and \u201cNous tous\u201d (\u201cAll of us\u201d).But the campaign\u2014a toxic one, tinged with genuine worries, half-truths, and outright lies\u2014is not helping him. Among other things, a lack of serious policy debate means that the specific policies on which he is campaigning are unexamined, which may make them harder to implement even if his party and its smaller allies maintain their majority in the legislative elections set for June, especially if his victory over Ms Le Pen is narrow. The change he promised in 2016 is at best only half delivered, and the strangely unifying insurgency that brought him to power is ill-suited to winning over the voters who remain unconvinced. Governing France could turn out to be even harder next time around.

She sued, arguing that the state law authorising surrogacy contracts was unconstitutional because it treats babies \u201cas a commodity or as chattel\u201d. This and successive attempts to retain her parental rights failed. When the triplets were born Ms Cook was not allowed to see them.Six years later, having exhausted all legal avenues, including an attempt to get the case before the Supreme Court, Ms Cook remains consumed by anxiety about the children, all boys, according to Harold Cassidy, her lawyer. \u201cThe last we heard he had lost his house and they were moving from motel to motel,\u201d he says. Robert Walmsley, the man\u2019s lawyer, says that is not true and that arguments made in court filings that the man was unfit to be a parent because he was deaf and mute are \u201cgrossly offensive and discriminatory\u201d.The case illustrates the legal and ethical messes that can arise in a surrogacy market that is largely unregulated. America has no federal law governing such arrangements. Most states allow paid surrogacy; some regulate it loosely. National data are scarce. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says 18,400 babies were born to gestational surrogates (that is, using a donor egg) between 1999 and 2013. The fee paid to a surrogate can range from $30,000 to $60,000 out of a total cost\u2014including  fertilisation and fees for brokers and lawyers\u2014of $110,000-180,000.Three of the six states that once prohibited the business have legalised it: New Jersey in 2018, Washington in 2019 and New York in 2021. Poorer places have shut it down: Cambodia, India, Thailand and Nepal have outlawed cross-border surrogacy. Most European countries prohibit commercial surrogacy. Ukraine, where it is legal and a lot cheaper than in America, had become a big market, before Russia\u2019s invasion. But those who can afford it have long favoured America, with its advanced medical technology, healthy supply of egg donors and aggressive lawyering.Demand is rising across the rich world. Surrogacy brokers say they have observed the practice becoming more socially acceptable as celebrities have talked about using surrogates. Many agencies say gay couples constitute a growing proportion of their clients (lesbian couples who want children can mostly use sperm donors). That has influenced the lobbying of fertility-rights groups, which increasingly portray access to paid surrogacy as a gay-rights issue. On the other side of the argument, a belief that no one has a right to pay a woman to carry a baby has unified some conservatives and some feminists.Proponents of paid surrogacy point out that the market self-regulates in important ways. Unlike the business of buying sperm, it depends on the use of assisted reproductive technology, which is regulated federally. Brokers prefer surrogates with health insurance. Risa Levine, a lawyer who campaigns for better access to fertility treatments, says that if health insurance covered the cost of surrogacy it would bring new layers of protection and transparency. Some businesses now include some costs associated with surrogacy in benefits packages. Research suggests 15-20% of surrogates are army wives.To help avoid situations in which a surrogate, overwhelmed by maternal feeling, decides she wants to keep a baby, many agencies stipulate she must already be a mother. Opponents say that neither this, nor the use of donor eggs, which is now what most surrogacy involves, circumvents a bond between mother and child.Parental disputes about what should happen to an unborn baby, generally amid divorce, are more common than conflicts between parent and surrogate. New York\u2019s law allows one parent to use embryos that both once wanted, without forcing the other to pay child support. If a baby is born with a physical defect that might have prompted an abortion had it been known about earlier, the state\u2019s law forces parents to accept custody.Yet laws and contracts cannot fix everything. A contract may stipulate that abortion decisions are up to the paying parents, but no court would force a woman to go through with one. Health is also a concern. More than half the babies born in America to gestational surrogates are twins or triplets, which can take a dangerous toll. \u201cMy body, my choice\u201d, a refrain used by abortion-rights activists, is often cited by proponents of surrogacy to counter that worry. \u201cWhy do we fight so hard to allow women to choose not to have a baby but assume some aren\u2019t equipped to decide to become a surrogate?\u201d asks Ms Levine.The greatest fears concern children. In some states with little regulation, lawyers turn to procedures used in adoption, including background checks on prospective parents. Britain, where unpaid surrogacy is allowed but contracts cannot be enforced, is considering mandatory checks on both surrogates and parents. That is unlikely to happen in America. It could be \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d, says Mr Walmsley, the lawyer. \u201cDo we do background checks on everyone who has a child?\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/04/09/americas-childmaking-market-is-a-legal-and-ethical-minefield", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T12:53:30Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220409_USP001_0.jpg"},

But Ms Barty is far from the first tennis player to quit the sport in her prime.HE SURPRISE decision by Ash Barty, Australia\u2019s three-time grand-slam winner, to retire from tennis at the age of 25 has provoked much consternation. One commentator even suggested it was indicative of a different attitude towards the work-life balance among millennials. But Ms Barty is far from the first tennis player to quit the sport in her prime.Bjorn Borg was one of the sport\u2019s greats, winning five consecutive Wimbledon titles and six French championships. Born in 1956, he was very much a \u201cbaby boomer\u201d. But he quit tennis at the age of 26 in 1983, having lost the desire to keep playing (he made a short and unsuccessful comeback in the early 1990s). Martina Hingis, a Swiss player with five grand-slam titles, initially retired from the singles tour at just 22 in 2003.Perhaps Ms Barty\u2019s retirement came as such a shock because the recent trend has been for tennis players to keep going. The big three in the men\u2019s game\u2014Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic\u2014are 40, 35 and 34 respectively, while Sir Andy Murray is attempting a comeback at 34. On the women\u2019s side, 40-year-old Serena Williams has yet to announce her retirement, although she hasn\u2019t played since last year\u2019s Wimbledon.Clearly the competitive urge in some athletes is so strong that they choose to play even when they have earned millions and won every conceivable honour. As for the big three, their rivalry may be keeping them going. After winning the Australian Open in January, Mr Nadal has 21 grand slam titles while Mr Federer and Mr Djokovic have 20 each. To finish ahead of the other two might be the crowning achievement for any of them.But it is easy to imagine that, for other mortals, success may be almost as great a spur to retire as failure. A couple of tennis grand slams brings financial security for life, plus the scope to keep busy as a media commentator. Tennis involves endless hours of practice and fitness training, as well as ceaseless travel round the globe. Often, a successful tennis player will have started the sport at a very young age and will have had little time to do anything else. Ms Barty had achieved her dream of winning both Wimbledon and her own country\u2019s tournament, the Australian Open; perhaps she had no further goal to drive her forward?The most likely reason for retirement in many sports is injury. Sandy Koufax, an outstanding baseball pitcher, retired in 1966 at the relatively young age of 30, having just won his third Cy Young award for best pitcher. He gave up in the face of crippling arthritis which had dogged him for the previous two years. \u201cI don\u2019t regret for one minute the 12 years I\u2019ve spent in baseball,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I could regret one season too many.\u201d More recently, Andrew Luck, the quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, retired at 29 after a long series of injuries that included a torn shoulder, a lacerated kidney and a nagging ankle problem.Physical-contact sports like American football or rugby result in a vast range of injuries. But a non-contact sport like tennis still makes enormous demands of the body. Sir Andy now has a metal hip; Mr Nadal has suffered a long series of injuries, in particular to his left foot; Mr Federer has had back problems and, in recent years, has needed operations on his knees. The scrambling, stretching and chasing involved in tennis puts a lot of strain on the joints. Indeed, the sport has a particular injury (tennis elbow) named after it. The real surprise is not that some stars retire early; it is that they keep going so long.

{"title": "Songbirds get more colourful the closer they live to the equator", "content": "WHEN THE Prussian naturalist  arrived in South America in 1799, the colours astonished him. \u201cLook at the blossoms, the birds,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven the crayfish are blue and yellow.\u201d Prussian naturalist  arrived in South America in 1799, the colours astonished him. \u201cLook at the blossoms, the birds,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEven the crayfish are blue and yellow.\u201dIn the intervening centuries, Humboldt\u2019s musings have morphed into an informal, if controversial, hypothesis about the world\u2019s living things: that organisms in equatorial climes are more colourful than those nearer the poles.In a new paper in , Chris Cooney, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sheffield, and colleagues at Britain\u2019s  collection in Tring, offer what they call the most comprehensive examination of this hypothesis to date, demonstrating that it does indeed apply for an order of birds known as passerines, a family of songbirds which includes the blue tit and the robin.Over several years, Dr Cooney\u2019s team photographed 4,527 birds from the museum\u2019s archives\u2014representing roughly half the total bird diversity on Earth. As passerine birds are sensitive to ultraviolet () light as well as visible, they see more colours than humans. The researchers therefore took pictures under  light, to get true bird\u2019s-eye views.A machine-learning algorithm was then let loose on the images, to identify the colours of the plumage (in values of red, green, blue and ultraviolet) at hundreds of points on each specimen. The total number of colours found on each bird was then subsequently mapped onto the geographic distribution of their parent species.The researchers used this data to derive a measure for how colourful different regions of the world were. The key factor here was the diversity of colours on individual birds. The paradise tanager (- pictured above), for example, which struts through the Amazon rainforest in a green domino mask, an azure bib fading into a sky-blue apron and a black cape splashed with all the colours of a sunset, is a sign of a colourful region. The monochromatic dunnock (), meanwhile, which flies across Europe with its brown wings streaked with darker brown, modulated by brown dots scattered across a dark grey face, was surefire evidence of a less colourful region.Equatorial birds, the researchers concluded, were indeed more colourful than their cousins in temperate regions, with colourfulness declining with latitude. The birds sampled at the equator had, on average, between 90 and 100 different colours, while birds at 60 degrees latitude had closer to 70 colours. Such trends related to latitude are not uncommon in ecology, with species diversity also having been shown to peak at the equator.Over the decades, numerous explanations have been tendered for tropical colourfulness. Some have speculated that warmer climates make more resources available to their inhabitants, allowing them to spend energy on developing adornments. Others have suggested that the bright colours may arise from chemical compounds in their diet, or else allow for breeding pairs to spot one another in the darker environment of a tropical forest floor.The authors of the latest study do not make any definitive conclusions on the matter, but their analysis shows that colourfulness is strongly associated with the resources available to birds in an environment, as well as its diversity. Whether such results can be extrapolated to other families of birds\u2014or, indeed, other classes of animal\u2014remains to be seen. After years spent photographing avian specimens from a variety of angles, Dr Cooney has high hopes that a similar study can be performed on butterflies. Crucially, they can be made to lie flat.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/songbirds-get-more-colourful-the-closer-they-live-to-the-equator/21808592", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T15:00:19Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_stp002.jpg"},

To most non-Swedes there are probably few odours more repulsive\u2014the fish has been described variously as smelling like rancid cat litter, vaguely faecal or even corpse-like. In determining which scents people find pleasant and which they do not, suggests culture must play a sizeable part.New research, however, suggests that might not be the case. Artin Arshamian, a neuroscientist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, and Asifa Majid, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, began with the expectation that culture would play an important role in determining pleasant smells. This was not just because of examples like that of fermented herring. They had noticed from their own previous work that people from different cultures described odours differently. They also knew from past experiments by other researchers that culture was important in determining which sorts of faces people found beautiful. Thus, they expected to see a similar phenomenon with smells.To study how scent and culture relate, Dr Arshamian and Dr Majid presented nine different groups of people with ten odours. These varied from pleasant-smelling  extract to isovaleric acid, the chemical responsible for the revolting scent of stinky socks. More intermediate odours, which the team thought might split opinions, included octanoic acid with its moderately rancid smell; the sweet-smelling eugenol, which comes from cloves; and octenol, a musty and earthy scent found in many mushrooms.The cultures doing the smelling varied widely too. They included hunter-gatherer communities along the coast of Mexico, subsistence farmers living in the highlands of Ecuador, shoreline foragers, swidden horticulturalists living in the tropical rainforests of Malaysia, and city folk from Thailand and Mexico City. All 235 participants were asked to rank odours according to pleasantness. The team compared their results to earlier work on New Yorkers who had been exposed to the same scents.Writing in  this week, the researchers noted that pleasantness rankings of the odours were remarkably consistent regardless of where people came from. The smell of isovaleric acid was reviled by the vast majority of the participants, only eight giving it a score of 1 to 3 on the pleasantness scale (where 1 was very pleasant and 10 was very unpleasant). On the other hand, more than 190 people gave vanilla extract a score of 1 to 3 and a tiny minority, only 12 people, found it revolting enough to rate 8 to 10. Overall, the chemical composition of the odourants that the researchers presented explained 41% of the reactions that participants had. In contrast, cultural upbringing accounted for just 6% of the results. Dr Arshamian and Dr Majid point out that this is very different from how visual perception of faces works\u2014in that case a person\u2019s culture accounts for up to 50% of the explanation for which faces they find beautiful.Even so, while culture did not shape perceptions of odours in the way that it is known to shape perceptions of faces, the researchers did find an \u201ceye of the beholder\u201d effect. Randomness, which Dr Arshamian and Dr Majid suggest has to be coming from personal preferences learned from outside individual culture, accounted for 54% of the variance in which smells people liked. \u201cOlfactory bulb of the beholder\u201d does not slip off the tongue so easily but it too appears to be a real phenomenon.

They find those with s increase returns on assets in the five years after their appointment\u2014by a total of three percentage points on average in America and 1.5 points in Denmark.

In short, ushering s into corner offices seems to boost shareholder value by slicing the pie in certain ways, not by making the pie bigger.The researchers put this phenomenon down to change in business-school syllabuses.  programmes, says Mr He, have over the years grown less focused on technical aspects of finance and management, and more obsessed with maximising shareholder value and corporate leanness. The result, he and his colleagues contend, is that workers have increasingly been seen as \u201ccosts to be reduced\u201d rather than an investment in human capital.People drawn to  courses in the first place may, of course, simply be more ruthless than holders of other degrees. But there may be something to the syllabus hypothesis. Chief executives who earned their s after 1980 were likelier to stint on employees than graduates from earlier  classes. If the general shareholder-friendly zeitgeist which took hold around that time were the whole explanation for this intergenerational difference, then s and non-s ought to be equally affected. The study shows this was not the case.

Nearly every big technology firm is rushing to develop a  or  headset, convinced that what has long been a niche market may be on the brink of becoming something much larger.Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, has sold 10m or so Quest 2 devices in the past 18 months; Cambria, its more advanced headset, is coming this year. Microsoft is pitching its pricier HoloLens 2 to businesses. Apple is expected to unveil its first headset by early 2023 and is said to have a next-generation model in the pipeline. Google is working on a set of goggles known as Iris. And a host of second-tier tech firms, from ByteDance to Sony and Snap, are selling or developing eyewear of their own.The tech giants spy two potentially vast markets. One is the kit itself.

Apple and Google have established themselves as landlords of the smartphone world, taxing every purchase on their app stores and setting rules on things like advertising, at the expense of digital tenants such as Facebook. Whoever corners the headset market stands to acquire a similarly powerful gatekeeping position. \u201cIt is going to be the next big wave of technology,\u201d says Mr Ubrani, \u201cand they all want to make sure they get a piece of that.\u201dThe search for the next platform comes as the last one shows signs of maturing. Smartphone shipments in America fell from a peak of 176m units in 2017 to 153m in 2021, according to . The advertising model that has powered firms like Facebook and Google is under attack from privacy advocates.

Since buying Oculus, a headset-maker, for $2bn in 2014, Meta has captured the market, with 80% of  sales by volume in 2021. The Quest 2, which offers a convincing (if mildly nauseating) experience with no need for an accompanying computer, has been a hit since its launch in 2020, helped by lockdowns and a $299 loss-leader price. Last Christmas the Quest\u2019s smartphone app was the most-downloaded in America. Smaller rivals like , a Taiwanese electronics firm, and Valve, an American games developer, which make  gear for gaming, are being squeezed. Pico, a headset-maker owned by ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner, is doing well in its home market, where Meta is banned.Meta\u2019s  strategy still revolves around ads. It is selling headsets as fast as it can in order to build an audience for advertisers, says George Jijiashvili of Omdia, a firm of analysts. Horizon Worlds and Venues, its virtual spaces for hanging out, claim 300,000 monthly visitors. To the irritation of some of them, Meta has already experimented with running ads there. The Cambria, a more expensive \u201cpass-through\u201d headset that combines a -like screen with front-mounted cameras to display footage of the world outside, will train cameras on users\u2019 faces. That will enable the capture of facial expressions in virtual form\u2014as well as the monitoring of which ads eyeballs linger on.Meta is also monetising its app store. From next year the market for  content will surpass that for  hardware, reckons Omdia. One of Mr Zuckerberg\u2019s motives for pushing the new platform is to liberate Meta from dependence on phonemakers for the distribution of its apps. The firm has become a digital landlord itself, with the power to tax Quest-store pur chases in the same way that Apple and Google take a cut of smartphone app sales (Meta declines to say how much it charges).While Meta ramps up its efforts in , others are experimenting with the knottier technology of . Unlike , which takes you to another place,  is \u201canchored in the world around you\u201d, says Evan Spiegel, boss of Snap. His Snapchat social-media app has long provided  filters for phones, allowing users to turn themselves into cartoon characters or virtually try on products like clothes and make-up with the help of their device\u2019s camera. Snap is now toying with hardware, building a prototype set of  Spectacles, which have gone out to a few hundred software developers.Your correspondent wandered through a floating solar system and was chased around Snap\u2019s London offices by holographic zombies as he tried out the Specs, which at 134 grams look and feel like a chunky pair of sunglasses. The downside of their slender styling is a battery life of 30 minutes and a tendency to overheat. Limits in optical technology restrict the field of view to a square in the middle of the lens, meaning that overlaid graphics are seen as if through a letterbox. Snap\u2019s main reason for making the device is to discover use cases for  headsets when they become widely adopted, says Mr Spiegel. In the hardware market, \u201cWe have a shot. But our goal is still really on the  platform itself.\u201dFor now,  glasses are a niche within a niche. High cost and wobbly performance limit their appeal.  expects industry shipments of 1.4m units this year. The top seller in 2021 was Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens 2, a $3,500 device used by big clients including America\u2019s armed forces (whose order for 100,000 pairs provoked complaints from Microsoft staff that they \u201cdid not sign up to develop weapons\u201d). Magic Leap, a startup in Florida, will launch the second generation of its  glasses, with a wider field of view, in September. It is targeting industries like health care and manufacturing, rather than consumers.Despite \u2019s dominance of the headset space,  sparks more excitement about mass adoption. Even with Meta\u2019s relentless promotion of virtual concerts, office meetings and more, few people use  for anything other than gaming: 90% of the $2bn spent on  content last year went on games, according to Omdia. Tim Cook, Apple\u2019s boss, has criticised \u2019s tendency to \u201cisolate\u201d the user. \u201cThere are clearly some cool niche things for . But it\u2019s not profound in my view,\u201d Mr Cook has said. \u201c  is profound.\u201d Apple has shown notably little interest in the immersive metaverse that excites Mr Zuckerberg.Apple\u2019s upcoming pass-through headset will give a taste of the  experience. A pair of true  glasses are still in early development. These first products are said to be aimed at designers and other creative professionals, rather like its high-end Macintosh computers. Still, the firm\u2019s entry into the industry could prove to be a watershed. \u201cApple\u2019s ability to drive adoption is probably unparalleled in the market,\u201d says Mark Shmulik of Bernstein, a broker. It will hope to do brisk business in China, giving it an edge over Meta.  predicts that in 2026, 20m pairs of  glasses could be shipped worldwide, making them about twice as popular as  goggles are today.The big question is whether headsets can go beyond gamers and professionals, and become a true tech platform rather than just an accessory. Today\u2019s  and  gear is good at solving \u201cvery specific pain-points\u201d, says Tony Fadell, a former Apple executive who helped develop the iPhone. A generalisable platform such as an iPhone \u201cis a whole different story\u201d, he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he adds, at least for the next five years. In the foreseeable future, Mr Fadell thinks, headsets will be a bit like smart watches, popular but not revolutionary in the way the smartphone has been.Mr Spiegel agrees that headsets will not fully replace phones, just as phones have not done away with desktop computers. But, he points out, \u201cone overarching narrative is that computing has become way more personal.\u201d It has moved from the mainframe, to the desktop, to the palm of the hand. The next step, he believes, is for computing to be \u201coverlaid on the world around you\u201d by . Desktop computing was mainly about information processing, and smartphones were mainly about communication. The next era of computing, he suggests, will be \u201cexperiential\u201d.In this scenario headsets could be part of a broader ecosystem of wearable technology that draws consumers\u2019 attention\u2014and spending power\u2014away from the smartphones that have hypnotised them for the past decade and a half. With smart watches, smart earphones and, soon, smart spectacles, the phone could become personal computing\u2019s back office rather than its primary interface. Gadgets on your eyes would complement the \u201cthings on our wrists, things on our ears and things in our pockets\u201d, thinks Mr Shmulik. One day, he speculates, \u201cyou might even forget that you\u2019ve got your phone.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/09/from-apple-to-google-big-tech-is-building-vr-and-ar-headsets", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T09:25:01Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_wbp001.jpg"},

Mr Orban called it a triumph for \u201cour brand of Christian democratic, conservative, patriotic politics\u201d. It was actually a victory for the paranoid style.The threats the regime describes are largely imaginary. Hungarians are free to follow their traditions if they choose. George Soros has no power over their borders. There is no global conspiracy to corrupt Hungarian children. And the fact that the opposition do not share Mr Orban\u2019s admiration for Vladimir Putin does not mean they are warmongers. No matter. Since Mr Orban took office in 2010 he has won control of nearly every significant media outlet. The opposition leader, Peter Marki-Zay, had only five minutes on public television during the campaign\u2014barely enough to introduce himself, let alone dam a river of lies.Mr Orban\u2019s victory entrenches a corrupt and semi-authoritarian regime in the heart of the European Union, the world\u2019s premier club of liberal democracies. Every year he is in office, he erodes more democratic checks and balances. Most of the opposition united against him during this election, worrying that if they did not stop him now, it would be too late. They failed.Hungary has shown once again how well fearmongering works. Voters are never more attentive than when hearing about threats, even phoney ones. Because of social media, unscrupulous politicians can easily spread vivid, viral footage that appears to support their scare stories. If such types win power, they are likely to abuse it. Even in a liberal democracy, as Hungary once was, a determined would-be strongman can chip away at independent institutions, such as the media or the courts, until his voice drowns out every other.Mr Putin\u2019s regime is very different from Mr Orban\u2019s, which does not kill people. Yet their styles overlap. The Kremlin also lies to scare voters into seeking the big man\u2019s protection. Its mouthpieces tell Russians that they are about to be attacked by the West, which has been developing bioweapons in Ukraine, a country run by Nazis. None of this is true, but viewers of Russian  hear little else. Many therefore rally around their president. Many believe the fresh lies with which their ruler reinforces his old ones, for example that the photos of Ukrainian civilians tied up and murdered in Bucha are a \u201cstaged provocation by the Kiev regime\u201d.  sent a reporter to check; he came back with his clothes stinking of death.Thousands of kilometres away, in another very different country, a third leader is inventing threats as a way to cling to power. A , the prime minister of Pakistan, was scheduled for April 3rd. The deputy speaker of parliament, an ally of the former cricket star, declared it a plot by the United States and cancelled it. Political chaos ensued. Mr Khan is said to have lost the support of Pakistan\u2019s army, which often meddles in politics. He no doubt calculates that in a fresh election, which he has called, it will do him no harm if voters believe he stood up to a wicked American conspiracy. There is no evidence of one.Starting on April 10th, under a political system unlike Hungary\u2019s, Russia\u2019s or Pakistan\u2019s, . Marine Le Pen relies on exaggeration rather than lies, and tries to put a respectable face on fearmongering. She frets about France\u2019s \u201csubmersion\u201d by a flood of immigrants.

More common are leaders who win power by sowing fear and division. For all their many differences, such leaders all pose a threat to tolerance and decency. To defeat them, liberals must neither underestimate them, as they did Donald Trump in 2016, nor copy their tactics. In the long run, lies must be fought with truth, painstakingly researched and patiently expressed. It will be a long struggle.

A painted Russian Orthodox saint looks sternly down from the wall at the gaggle of old ladies gathered beneath. Then a little dog starts yapping as Timur Matsaberidze, a 27-year-old ship\u2019s cook, strides through the door. The old ladies grin.Odessa is one of the few big cities to have escaped bombardment since Russia invaded Ukraine weeks ago, but supplies are running low and most of its shops are closed. Local government officials are too busy organising the city\u2019s defence to ensure that food gets to the elderly, so that task has fallen to volunteers like Matsaberidze. There are 80 old people affiliated with the pensioners\u2019 club, he explains, as he and his crew unload macaroni, rice and potatoes from a battered, white Mercedes van parked outside: \u201cThe government can\u2019t help them, so I do.\u201dMatsaberidze looks like he\u2019d be more at home in a seedy port bar than among a group of grannies. He\u2019s bony and heavily tattooed with a shaven head and clownish smile. But the old ladies can\u2019t get enough of him. They\u2019re murmuring thanks and blessings, and the white-haired director of the pensioners\u2019 club is reaching for Matsaberidze\u2019s hand when his phone starts buzzing and he has to head back to the van. There\u2019s no time to chat.Odessa has been on edge for weeks. Beaches that once welcomed Russian tourists are being mined, and the city centre is full of tank traps and barricades. Everyone knows Odessa could be cut off from the world at any time: there are Russian troops to the east and west, and a fleet of Russian naval vessels close by in Crimea. Air-raid sirens go off regularly, sending people scampering into bomb shelters.The nervous energy has infected Matsaberidze. He\u2019s hardly had time for a cup of tea since Russia invaded, he says; the only thing I see him consume in our two days together is a single half-cooked potato. From first thing in the morning until the curfew starts at 8pm he\u2019s on the road, delivering food and clothes to soldiers, retirees, disabled people and anyone else in need, trailed by a small posse of sailors and musicians. After unloading all the food the crew heads back to the van, the side of which is plastered with the words \u201cRussian Ship, Go Fuck Yourself\u201d. (The phrase, reportedly uttered by a Ukrainian border guard who was asked to surrender, has become a rallying cry across Ukraine.) As he moves to open the door, Matsaberidze giggles, nudging a dog poo with his shoe and citing a Ukrainian proverb that says stepping in it will bring good luck. Odessa needs it.t the wheel of the van sits Yaroslav Prokhorov, an old friend of Matsaberidze. Long-haired and good-looking, Prokhorov was a semi-successful drummer until the war forced all nightclubs to close. In the back is Matsaberidze\u2019s cousin Nikolai, a heavy-set boatswain on a merchant shipping line. The half-dozen others who come and go throughout the day are a likeable, bohemian lot, with little money and a typically Odessan mix of backgrounds; one tells me that she is part-Jewish, part-Muslim and part-Roma.The van is filthy, with old cardboard and plastic bags on the floor; most of the seats have been ripped out to make room for deliveries. This space is filled with a random assortment of goods ranging from medicine and nappies to vodka for the soldiers. Matsaberidze says some of those guarding the city\u2019s entrances are literally shivering from hunger (he immediately regrets telling me this because he fears it will harm morale if it got out). One of their friends was called up for active duty and was given no armour or boots, Prokhorov adds, so they crowdfunded to buy him some.As we lurch round a corner, Matsaberidze fills me in on his day so far. \u201cI got up this morning, no breakfast, no time for it,\u201d he says, speaking rapidly in what he calls \u201cSeaman\u2019s English\u201d (vaguely accented and short on prepositions). \u201cFive thousand people hungry in Odessa.\u201d Matsaberidze calls their method for sourcing supplies \u201cthe Odessa system\u201d: a mix of charm, chutzpah and connections, sometimes brushing the edge of legality. He wheedles restaurant owners or wholesalers for leftover food, persuades people fleeing Ukraine to donate anything they don\u2019t need and picks up whatever he can on the city\u2019s lively black market. Social media helps too. Recently a single mother texted him in urgent need of nappies and baby food. Realising that he didn\u2019t have anything suitable, he posted a call-out on Facebook and Instagram. He managed to find someone who had the right size of nappies, drove to his apartment and then delivered the goods to the mother. He\u2019s juggling several such supply chains in any given day. \u201cIt shows how our city works \u2013 a very big communication, very open to all people, very spontaneous,\u201d he says. He tries to help with most requests, though he does mention one woman who asked him to break into a neighbour\u2019s apartment and loot it for her. \u201cI said to her \u2018no, I\u2019m not a criminal\u2019.\u201dThe soldiers manning the city\u2019s checkpoints are jumpy, fearing Russian saboteurs. Recently, a member of Matsaberidze\u2019s team was making a delivery just after curfew when a group of soldiers fired their guns in the air and forced him to his knees. Some unlucky Odessans have been shot in similar circumstances. \u201cIt\u2019s so chaotic now,\u201d Matsaberidze says. \u201cIf a Russian guy came to my house, I could kill him, throw his body out and nobody would say anything.\u201dIt\u2019s not just the city\u2019s human population that benefits from the battered Mercedes. After we turn out of Spartakovskaya street, Matsaberidze tells me we\u2019re on our way to feed some raccoons at a petting zoo. Animals need to eat too. A woman in a green blouse instructs us to empty our pockets before entering the animals\u2019 room: the naughty raccoons will steal everything. A minute later, dozens of furry, lumbering creatures envelop us. Matsaberidze picks one up and it nuzzles him like a dog. The animals seem to make everyone happy. \u201cIn this hard time, when you come to this place, it\u2019s very good for you,\u201d says Matsaberidze. He disentangles himself with reluctance.he streets of Odessa are mostly deserted these days, but advertising hoardings bear new patriotic slogans. \u201cIf you mess with Mama, Mama will bury you\u201d, says one, a playful reference to the city\u2019s long-standing nickname, \u201cMama Odessa\u201d. Joking is intrinsic to Odessa\u2019s identity. The city is known for its comedy clubs and has an annual festival of humour on April Fools\u2019 Day (this year it\u2019s been cancelled). Many of the Soviet Union\u2019s most famous comedians were from Odessa, including Leonid Utyosov, a personal favourite of Stalin, and Mikhail Zvhanetsky, who was once described as the \u201cSeinfeld of everyday Soviet misery\u201d. Matsaberidze says he even met Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, at a comedy gig in the city when the country\u2019s wartime hero was just doing stand-up (\u201cnice guy\u201d).It\u2019s hard to say exactly what Odessa\u2019s sense of humour consists of: \u201cIt is like bitcoin\u201d, ventures Matsaberidze, trying to work out how to capture its mixture of sadness and irreverence. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist, but it exists.\u201d Others agree it carries an expectation of misfortune that speaks to the city\u2019s history. After Catherine the Great founded Odessa as a free port in the late 18th century, it became a polyglot hub for Bulgarians, Greeks, Poles, Russians and other groups. Much of the city\u2019s distinctive neoclassical architecture was built during its prosperous 19th century. Since then it has been in a state of protracted, crime-ridden decline; its Jewish population reduced from a third of the city\u2019s inhabitants to just a small fraction by successive pogroms, followed by the Holocaust.Unsurprisingly, the city\u2019s humour has always tended towards the pitch-black. \u201cBarber, why must you always talk politics?\u201d runs one of the best gags from the Stalin era. The answer? \u201cBecause your hair is so much easier to cut when it stands on end.\u201dSome of the best jokes I heard in Odessa came from Rabbi Avraham Wolff, a ruddy-faced 50 year-old with a greying beard, who has been trying to help the city\u2019s remaining Jews escape. \u201cEvery time you throw a rock you hit a Jew or a cat,\u201d the rabbi says cheerfully. \u201cThe last time this happened, Moses brought the Jewish people out of Israel. They also had no passports.\u201dNot all Odessan wit translates. At the end of one day\u2019s scavenging, Matsaberidze says to me apropos of nothing: \u201cWe trust in the armed forces of Ukraine, God and the !\u201d I\u2019m not sure whether I am supposed to laugh, repeat it back to him or look solemn. He shrugs: \u201cIt sounds better in Ukrainian.\u201d vast, frenetic citizens\u2019 movement is coalescing in Odessa. Groups of women gather to make camouflage netting. Men weld old train rails into tank barriers. Other volunteers have been lugging mattresses and blankets down into the city\u2019s vast 19th-century network of subterranean catacombs. It\u2019s hard to say how long this newfound unity will endure. Before the war, Odessa was divided between those who felt aligned with Moscow (the city has a particularly high concentration of ethnic Russians) and those who saw themselves as primarily Ukrainian. The two factions clashed violently after the Euromaidan protests in Kyiv in 2014. Moscow\u2019s subsequent invasion of eastern Ukraine turned many in Odessa against Russia, especially young people like Matsaberidze, but the webs of money and influence linking the city to its former rulers remained strong.On the city\u2019s southern beachfront, I meet a few dozen people making sandbags to use for fortifications. One of them, a tall, striking figure with long hair and huge eyes, is singing the national anthem, \u201cUkraine Has Not Yet Perished\u201d. He turns out to be Andriy Kharlamov, a 33-year-old bass baritone with the Odessa National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre. When the song is over, he tells me that at least 20 other classical musicians he knows are now part of the civil defence. He laughs about it, but when I ask about their prospects for returning to music his face turns sober. \u201cWe must be realistic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said coronavirus would be over in two weeks. I think this war will last years, like Afghanistan. The Russians don\u2019t want this to end.\u201d The translator I am working with, a young woman who has chosen to stay in Odessa with her husband and two children, bursts into tears.After dropping off some spare goods in the makeshift depot in Prokhorov\u2019s garage, Matsaberidze invites me back to his own flat in a working-class neighbourhood. The tiny apartment is at the end of a dim, sour-smelling cement corridor. It has almost no furniture and one window is made of plastic sheeting and tape. Matsaberidze was able to buy it after spending an entire year on a container ship during the pandemic, saving most of his monthly salary of $1,400. One of his cousins has been napping on the single sofa. A pot of congealed lentils sits on the table. I point to Matsaberidze\u2019s abundant tattoos, and he obligingly explains a few of them: a ship, a pot-smoking tiger with reddish eyes, an ancient sun symbol. And, of course, a mermaid (\u201cit\u2019s logical\u201d). In between seemingly endless phone calls, Matsaberidze tells me how he came to be the Robin Hood of Odessa.When the war broke out the first thing he did was help his ex-wife and their eight-year-old daughter escape to Moldova, leaving him with only $250 to his name. His girlfriend wanted to leave too, and he gave her $150 for the journey \u2013 she hadn\u2019t decided where to go. Left alone with his two-month old kitten, Mireslava, he sat on the sofa: \u201cI closed the door, watched the news, saw the attacks. I really started crying, asking, what can I do? I cannot just watch.\u201dAs he was wondering what to do, the phone rang. It was Prokhorov, also in tears. \u200b\u200bMatsaberidze hadn\u2019t spoken to him in more than a decade because of a row over a girl, but the war seemed to make that feud irrelevant. The old friends traded rumours: both had heard that the city\u2019s defenders were cold and hungry. They decided to meet up the next day to gather food and clothes for them \u2013 Prokhorov had the family van because his parents had already fled. After that, \u201cit was like magic, snowball,\u201d Matsaberidze says. The municipal authorities have noticed Matsaberidze\u2019s resourcefulness. As I was preparing to leave Odessa he told me he had been allocated a bomb shelter to use as an office and storage space. He gave me a brief tour: the ratty-looking basement smelled faintly of bilge water. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Sheraton five-star, but there are three exits, that\u2019s really good,\u201d he says. An old man appears to have moved into one of the rooms, and Matsaberidze chats amiably with him. Anyone is welcome.I shiver in the cold. Matsaberidze sees, and gleefully uses the opportunity to advance one of his theories about the city. Apparently the temperature dropped just as the Russians invaded. Do I know why? \u201cIt\u2019s because of witches making spells. We have lots of witches,\u201d he says, grinning with pride at Odessa\u2019s unstoppable eccentricity. \u201cAlmost everyone, actually.\u201d  is the author of \u201cA Rage for Order: the Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS\u201d.

Many things appeared to be going well. The population was growing and people were living longer, wealthier and happier lives. No longer. Over the past ten years Russians have begun to die younger, and are becoming fewer, poorer . The first hit was to the economy. The annexation of Crimea in 2014 was greeted with cheers in Russia. But it brought a wave of sanctions and triggered a collapse in oil prices. The subsequent recession hit the economy hard. Average incomes fell, especially for the poorest half of the population. Although GDP per person rebounded by 2018, median incomes did not. According to the Luxembourg Income Study, they were still some 10% lower than their 2012 peak in 2019, the last year for which estimates are available. The World Happiness Report, based on surveys asking people to rate how they feel about their lives, found that the mood in Russia has dipped. Since 2017 Russians have rated themselves as less happy than in 2012.Then came the pandemic. Russia\u2019s official covid-19 death rate appears unremarkable. But those . According to \u2019s , its true death toll is among the world\u2019s highest. Some 1.2m people have died, about twice the rate in America, and nearly three times that in the EU. Combined with declining birth rates and migration, that means the country\u2019s population is smaller now than in 2012. In 2021 alone, the country\u2019s population dropped by 693,000, or about 0.5%. The Russo-Ukraine war has only made things worse. Although casualty numbers are uncertain and few compared with deaths from covid-19, they have been mounting rapidly, already running into thousands, and the soldiers who die are mostly young. And sanctions, unprecedented in their scale and ambition, have hit the already strained economy. So far, the economic fallout has been  than might have been expected, but most analysts expect it to worsen over the coming months. The IMF predicts a \u201cbad recession\u201d. The Institute of International Finance, a banker group, projects an economic contraction of 15%. That would undo the growth in real incomes over the past decade two times over. All of which is bad enough. But when compared with the world as a whole, or even rich countries in particular, Russia\u2019s decline looks even worse. Over the past decade, GDP in advanced economies has grown by 22%; across the world as a whole it has risen by 41% (both adjusting for price changes). Should projections of a 15% contraction be right, by the end of the year Russia\u2019s economy will be 7% smaller than in 2012. Russia has not just lost a decade of growth\u2014be it in economics, health or happiness. It is .In most democracies, such an unenviable record would spell trouble for the person at the top. But with his opponents locked up or in exile, elections far from free and fair, and the media under his control, Mr Putin has less to fear. The same cannot be said for those who live under his rule.

To the south, the hulk of a blasted tank remains on the road where it was destroyed, just before it reached the airport. In the north, the shell of an armoured personnel carrier lies opposite a home-improvements superstore. Look at the locations on the map and Russia\u2019s military logic becomes clear. Both lie diametrically opposite one another on the ring road around the city. Just as in Kyiv, the Russian assault on Kharkiv, which is less than an hour\u2019s drive south of the Russian border, has been thwarted. Just as in Kyiv the Russians remain to the north of the city and in an arc around the north-east. But there the similarity ends. Kharkiv has been subjected to massive and indiscriminate missile and artillery strikes which have hit the town centre and destroyed both obvious targets and random buildings across the entire city. Unlike Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kharkiv has also been attacked by Russian planes. At the central morgue around a hundred bodies lie in the courtyard. Some are in body bags; many are not. The pressure of war means that death certificates cannot be issued fast enough, explains Yuriy Kravchenko, the morgue\u2019s director, as three officials with clipboards stand in front of a line of unbagged bodies, trying to determine their exact cause of death. Day and night the sound of artillery and missiles rumbles across the city. Fighting is concentrated in the north-eastern district of North Saltivka. Here, whole blocks of residential homes have been laid to waste. Smoke billows above them. According to soldiers in what is now an otherwise ghostly and deserted area, the Russians are only 1.5km away. Having failed to advance since their initial disastrous attempt to take the city, they are now digging defensive positions. To the south, however, Ukrainian soldiers say that the Russians have been pushed back 40km. In full military gear and protected by armed guards, Oleh Synyehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, sits on a park bench to give an interview. His office, Kharkiv\u2019s now-gutted administrative building, is just across the city\u2019s Freedom Square, one of the largest in Europe. On March 1st it was hit by a Russian missile strike, 15 minutes after he would normally have begun his morning meeting with his staff. That day he was late. The number known to have died is 24, but workers are still digging in the rubble and may find more. No one knows how many have died in Kharkiv since the beginning of the war, but Nataliya Zubar, a political activist now collecting evidence of possible war crimes, thinks that a realistic figure for civilian deaths is about 1,000. Also unclear is the number of people who remain. Mr Synyehubov says that of a pre-war population of around 1.5m he believes 1m are still there. That seems optimistic. Maria Avdeeva, a think-tanker turned wartime videographer charting the fate of her city, thinks the true number could be as few as 300,000. Nothing, except for a few supermarkets and chemists, is working. Wherever humanitarian aid is being distributed, there are queues of hundreds of people. In front of a branch of Nova Poshta, a courier company, a van that would usually carry parcels pulls up with potatoes. Since March 5th, says Oleksandr, a Nova Poshta employee, this branch alone has been distributing aid to 1,200 people a day. It includes bread, cheese, frozen chicken, toothpaste, shampoo and nappies. Typical of those queuing is Jana, aged 56. She was a saleswoman in a food shop but lost her job when the war began. She has not even been paid for February, her last month of work, she says. Her flat is normally home to just her and her husband, but now there are seven people crammed into it as relatives who have fled dangerous outlying areas have come to stay. Although Kharkiv\u2019s centre was subjected to heavy attacks earlier in the war, it is now mostly quiet. But the risk is that, at any time, a missile can strike. On March 27th one gouged a massive crater in front of a 19th-century fire-brigade building, gutting the school opposite it as well. On March 24th at least six people died when a missile struck while hundreds were queuing for aid at a distribution point in the north-east of the city. Yevgeniy Selichev, aged 40, is one of the survivors of that attack and is now recovering from surgery in Kharkiv Regional Hospital. Yuriy Babalyan, head of the neurosurgery team there, says that if victims survive the initial impact of a missile, \u201cthen they have a good chance\u201d of living. The hospital is coping well. Enough medical staff have stayed, he says, and supplies continue to arrive. The real problem is the constant fear that the hospital could be hit. Igor Terekhov, Kharkiv\u2019s mayor, says that 15 hospitals or medical centres have been. Kharkiv is largely Russian-speaking and used to be instinctively Russophile. Most of its residents are shocked by the Russian attack. Ms Avdeeva is convinced that there is an element of revenge in the shelling because the Russians actually believed they would be welcomed as liberators. Now, she says, their strategy is to terrorise the city to make all normal life impossible and to pin down Ukrainian troops while Russian forces try to seize other parts of the country. Mr Synyehubov, however, believes that the Russians are now regrouping on the city\u2019s outskirts and preparing for another \u201cmassive\u201d attack. But, he adds confidently, \u201cWe are preparing for that.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/01/despite-a-ferocious-bombardment-kharkiv-has-held-out", "date_modified": "2022-04-01T15:47:01Z", "date_published": "2022-04-01T15:47:01Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220402_EUP514.jpg"},

Many Western analysts also expected Kyiv, the capital, to fall within 72 hours. Ukrainian valour and ingenuity confounded those assumptions.

Many Western analysts also expected Kyiv, the capital, to fall within 72 hours. Ukrainian valour and ingenuity confounded those assumptions. As the war enters its sixth week, the side that is contemplating victory is not Russia but Ukraine\u2014and it would be a victory that redraws the map of European security.Speaking to in Kyiv on March 25th, President Volodymyr Zelensky explained how people power is the secret to Ukraine\u2019s resistance and why the war is shifting in his nation\u2019s favour. \u201cWe believe in victory,\u201d he declared. \u201cThis is our home, our land, our independence. It\u2019s just a question of time.\u201dThe battlefield is starting to tell the same story as the president. After several weeks in which the Russian assault stalled, Ukrainian forces have begun to counter-attack. On March 29th Russia said that it will \u201cfundamentally cut back\u201d the northern campaign. Its retreat may well be only tactical, but Russia has in effect conceded that, for the moment, it cannot take Kyiv.Yet a lot of Ukraine remains in Russian hands, including the strip of land on the southern coast that the Russians now claim was their focus all along. A large chunk of the Ukrainian army, in the Donbas region, is vulnerable to encirclement. Nobody should underestimate Russian firepower. Even if its forces are depleted and demoralised they can dig in. Victory for Ukraine means keeping its Donbas brigades intact and using them to deny Russia a secure hold on occupied territory.For that, Mr Zelensky , the West must impose tougher sanctions on Russia and supply more weapons, including aircraft and tanks. Sanctions deplete Russia\u2019s ability to sustain a long war. Arms help Ukraine take back territory. But  countries are refusing to provide him with what he wants. Given what is at stake, for the West as well as Ukraine, that betrays a reprehensible failure of strategic vision.For Ukraine, a decisive victory would deter yet another Russian invasion. The more convincingly Ukraine can see off the Russian army, the more able it will be to resist the compromises that could poison the peace. Victory would also be the best basis for launching a post-war democratic state that is less corrupted by oligarchs and Russian infiltration.The prize for the West would be almost as great. Not only could Ukraine invigorate the cause of democracy, but it would also enhance European security. During 300 years of imperialism, Russia has repeatedly been at war in Europe. Sometimes, as with Poland and Finland, it was the invader. Other times, as with Nazi Germany and Napoleonic France, it was seen as a lethal threat and itself fell victim to aggression.A strong, democratic Ukraine would thwart Russia\u2019s expansionism\u2014because its borders would be secure. In the short term an angry, defeated dictator would be left in the Kremlin, but eventually Russia, following Ukraine\u2019s example, would be more likely to solve its problems by reform at home rather than adventures abroad. As it did so,  would become correspondingly less of a drain on budgets and diplomacy. The United States would be freer to attend to its growing rivalry with China.Alas, much of the West seems blind to this historic chance. America is leading as it must, even if it vetoed . But Germany is taking a short-term view of sanctions, balancing pressure from its allies and public opinion against the preservation of its trading links with Russia, the supplier of much of its oil and natural gas. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, claims to speak for Western allies when he argues that to supply the heavy weapons Ukraine needs would turn them into \u201cco-belligerents\u201d. Mr Zelensky accuses such countries of being either short-sighted or timorous. He is right.Perhaps Germany doubts that Ukraine can leave behind its post-Soviet past. It is true that, after the Maidan protests established democracy in 2014, the country was unable to slough off its corruption and political inertia. And after being pounded by Russian artillery, Ukraine\u2019s economy will be in ruins. However, the  can help ensure that this time is different by starting work on Ukrainian membership . There could be no greater affirmation of the \u2019s founding mission to create peace on a continent ravaged by war.Bringing Ukraine\u2019s governance in line with the \u2019s will necessarily be lengthy and bureaucratic. The risk is that Brussels strings Ukraine along, as if Europe is deigning to let it join. Instead, the  should welcome Ukraine eagerly, as eastern Europe was welcomed when it shook off Soviet domination in the early 1990s. That calls for generous aid to rebuild the economy, as well as political support and patience.The other worry is Mr Macron\u2019s: that  will provoke Russia. From the start of this war, when he spoke of \u201cconsequences\u2026such as you have never seen in your entire history\u201d, Mr Putin has hinted that Western involvement could lead to the use of nuclear weapons. Wisely, the West has therefore been clear that  will not fight against Russian forces\u2014because, if they did, the war could spin out of control, with catastrophic results.Yet backing away from Mr Putin\u2019s nuclear-tinged threat entails risks, too. Limiting Ukrainian aid would abet Russia in imposing an unstable\u2014and hence temporary\u2014peace on Mr Zelensky. It would reward Mr Putin for his threats, setting up his next act of atomic aggression. By contrast, more powerful weapons and sanctions would mark a change in the degree of aid, but not its kind. And this week, facing Ukrainian success, Russia paused the campaign in the north, rather than escalate. For all those reasons, the best deterrence is for  to stand up to Mr Putin\u2019s veiled threat, and make clear that a nuclear or chemical atrocity would lead to Russia\u2019s utter isolation.Conflict is unpredictable. History is littered with wars that were meant to be short but which dragged on for years. Ukraine has won the first phase of this one simply by surviving. Now it needs to advance, and so Mr Zelensky needs redoubled Western help. It would be terrible if what stood between a bad peace and a good one was a failure of imagination in the capitals of Europe.

{"title": "Macron still leads a tightening presidential race", "content": "\u201cIWANT IT  to be less like a rally,\u201d declares Emmanuel Macron in an electoral clip, as he strolls around the empty indoor arena west of Paris in an overcoat and scarf, scouting out the venue: \u201cI want something more like a sporting event.\u201d On April 2nd, a mere eight days before the first round of voting in France\u2019s two-round presidential election, the sitting president will finally hold his first election rally.

And a narrow second-round victory could spell trouble for a second-term president later on.  to be less like a rally,\u201d declares Emmanuel Macron in an electoral clip, as he strolls around the empty indoor arena west of Paris in an overcoat and scarf, scouting out the venue: \u201cI want something more like a sporting event.\u201d On April 2nd, a mere eight days before the first round of voting in France\u2019s two-round presidential election, the sitting president will finally hold his first election rally. He might need to take his gloves off at last. He is still the firm favourite. But the race is tightening in the final stretch. And a narrow second-round victory could spell trouble for a second-term president later on.The average gap between Mr Macron and his nearest rival, the nationalist-populist Marine Le Pen, has narrowed from 13 points on March 15th to seven points two weeks later, according to \u2019s poll of polls. On March 29th  still gave Mr Macron an 89% chance of re-election, and only a one-in-ten chance to Ms Le Pen. But two new polls suggest that, if the pair meet in the run-off as they did in 2017, his victory over her could be as narrow as 53% to 47%.As Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine drags on, the poll bump that Mr Macron enjoyed from being at the centre of diplomatic efforts to end it has begun to wear off. The French still seem to credit their president for trying, despite his lack of success. But they are now worried about the effects of the war on their wallets. Moreover, the initial damage suffered by three rival contenders\u2014Ms Le Pen, the far-right Eric Zemmour and the far-left Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2014owing to their past sympathy for Vladimir Putin seems to have had a lasting impact only on Mr Zemmour. Indeed Mr M\u00e9lenchon, a wise-cracking anti- firebrand who is against arming Ukraine, has crept up in the polls. With fully six candidates on the left, including a Communist and two Trotskyists, the sprightly 70-year-old is the tactical choice for leftist voters.Furthermore, Mr Macron is now saying things that the French do not much care to hear. During the pandemic, he focused on spending \u201cwhatever it costs\u201d to protect people and jobs. On March 17th he laid out his plans for a second term. Unlike his manifesto brochure in 2017, which was filled with smiling faces and exclamation marks, this year\u2019s displays sombre images and refers to the \u201cbrutal return of the tragic in history\u201d. Mr Macron promises, among other things, to raise the pension age from 62 years to 65; to oblige beneficiaries of basic benefits to enrol in training or work; and to pay teachers more only if they take on more tasks. Mr M\u00e9lenchon offers a more appealing alternative: \u201cRetirement at 65 with Macron, 60 with me.\u201dCharges that Mr Macron represents a cosy business elite have also resurfaced, after a report found the government spent \u20ac894m ($1bn) on private consulting firms in 2021. This is in line with other countries, but seen as an affront in statist France.Ms Le Pen, meanwhile, has campaigned deftly. On March 29th our model gave her an 84% chance of making it to the run-off. She has taken her promises to cut taxes on motor fuel and ease the cost of living to , leaving ranting about immigration to Mr Zemmour. At a time when old fears about migrants and Islamism have given way to support for refugees fleeing Ukraine, his diatribes have jarred. At an outdoor rally in Paris on March 27th, before a crowd waving French flags, his supporters chanted \u201cThis is our home!\u201d, an old far-right mantra. At one point, during a passage on the victims of terrorism, they broke into: \u201cMacron, murderer.\u201dIn short, despite having 12 candidates to pick from, voters on April 24th may, as last time, see a run-off between Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen. Some are already saying that, should he defeat her again, it would be a victory \u201cby default\u201d. Mr Macron can hardly be blamed for the mediocrity of his opponents, nor the poor campaigns of the mainstream left and right. Yet muttering about illegitimacy has already begun.

So great is the real-life tragedy that has befallen his nation that there is no room for acting. He talks of Ukraine\u2019s need for weapons, of his views of President Joe Biden and his other Western backers, of what victory would mean. But Mr Zelensky speaks most powerfully about the inhumanity of the Russian commanders ranged against him.\u201cThe invaders do not even mourn their own casualties,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is something I do not understand. Some 15,000 [Russian soldiers] have been killed in one month\u2026[Vladimir Putin] is throwing Russian soldiers like logs into a train\u2019s furnace. And, they are not even burying them\u2026 Their corpses are left in the streets. In several cities, small cities, our soldiers say it\u2019s impossible to breathe because of the\u2026 stench of rotting flesh.\u201dMr Zelensky compares the pitilessness of Mr Putin\u2019s war machine with the compassion of the soldiers and volunteers defending Ukrainian cities. \u201cOur fearless soldiers are defending Mariupol now\u2026They could have left a long time ago, but they are not leaving the city.\u201d After 31 days of bombardment and siege, they are still fighting\u2014not because Mr Zelensky ordered it, but because they \u201csay they must stay and bury those killed in action and save the lives of those wounded\u2026[And] long as people are still alive, we must continue to protect them. And this is the fundamental difference between the way the opposing sides in this war see the world.\u201dMr Putin and Mr Zelensky are both native Russian-speakers, but they talk a different language of power. Mr Putin\u2019s world, where life is cheap and history belongs to great men, has no place for pity and no room for Ukraine. \u201cI don\u2019t think he visualises in his own mind the same Ukraine we see,\u201d Mr Zelensky says. \u201cHe sees Ukraine as a part of his world, his worldview, but that doesn\u2019t correspond with what\u2019s happened over the last 30 years. I don\u2019t think Putin has been [in] a bunker for two weeks or six months, but for more like two decades.\u201dTo Mr Putin, strength means violence. Anyone too squeamish to shed blood is weak. That explains why the Russian army is using the same methods in occupied territory that it used in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine that Russia invaded using proxy militias in 2014. \u201cThey are kidnapping the mayors of our cities,\u201d Mr Zelensky says. \u201cThey killed some of them. Some of them we can\u2019t find. Some of them we have found already, and they are dead. And some of them were replaced\u2026The same people are carrying out these operations.\u201dMr Zelensky, by contrast, sees strength in the grit of the humble, unarmed Ukrainians who \u201cwaved their hands in the middle of the streets in order to stop tanks\u201d in Kherson, one of the cities now occupied by Russian forces. \u201cThey decided to stand up and do this of their own volition. I could not have ordered them not to do it or to throw themselves under the tank treads,\u201d he says. \u201cI will stay with these people until the end.\u201dHe is emphatic about what that end will be. \u201cWe believe in victory,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to believe in anything else. We will definitely win because this is our home, our land, our independence. It\u2019s just a question of time.\u201d However, getting there depends not just on the fighting spirit of Ukrainians, but also on support from the West. If Ukraine is to defend its way of life, he says, it needs tanks, armoured personnel vehicles and military aircraft\u2014and it needs them now.\u201c[The West] can\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019ll help you in the weeks [to come],\u2019\u201d Mr Zelensky argues. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t allow us to unblock Russia-occupied cities, to bring food to residents there, to take the military initiative into our own hands.\u201d And however strong the spirit of Ukraine\u2019s people, Russia has far more firepower. \u201cThe Russians have thousands of military vehicles, and they are coming and coming and coming. If we can joke in this situation, I will. There are some cities where there are so many tanks, they can\u2019t go away. They have tank traffic jams,\u201d he says.Mr Zelensky divides  into five camps. First are those who \u201cdon\u2019t mind a long war because it would mean exhausting Russia, even if this means the demise of Ukraine and comes at the cost of Ukrainian lives\u201d. Others want a quick end to the fighting because \u201cRussia\u2019s market is a big one [and] their economies are suffering\u201d. A third, more diverse group of countries \u201crecognise Nazism in Russia\u201d and want Ukraine to prevail. They are joined by smaller liberal countries that \u201cwant the war to end quickly at any cost, because they think people come first\u201d. And last are the embarrassed countries that want peace right away and in any way possible, because they are \u201cthe offices of the Russian Federation in Europe\u201d.Mr Zelensky praises America and Britain. Although he notes that the complexities of American politics have sometimes caused delays, he acknowledges that Mr Biden has become increasingly engaged. But Germany, he says, is trying to strike a balance between Russia and Ukraine. \u201cThey have a long relationship with Russia and they are looking at the situation through the prism of the economy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey can help, if there is pressure on them domestically to do so, and they can stop when they see what they have done is sufficient.\u201d Asked why leaders like President Emmanuel Macron of France say Ukraine\u2019s partners could not supply tanks to help Ukraine win, he retorts, \u201cThey are afraid of Russia. And that\u2019s it.\u201dMr Zelensky is equally frustrated by the reactive nature of sanctions that are designed to punish Russia for what it has done rather than prevent it from going further. Existing sanctions have loopholes. Russia\u2019s largest bank, Sberbank, for example, has not been cut off from the  payment system, because it is one of the main ways Europe pays for its gas. America has imposed an embargo on Russian oil and gas but Europe, a far bigger customer, has not. \u201cThe first thing is to put yourselves in our place and act pre-emptively\u2026We are hearing that the decision depends on whether Russia launches a chemical attack on us. This is not the right approach. We are not guinea pigs.\u201dWhat does Mr Zelensky believe victory will look like? He pauses, before delivering the sort of answer that would be simply unimaginable coming from Mr Putin: \u201cVictory is being able to save as many lives as possible\u2026because without this nothing would make sense. Our land is important, yes, but ultimately, it\u2019s just territory.\u201d To save everyone, defend all interests while protecting people and not giving up territory is probably an impossible task, he concedes. He does not know when or how it will end, but he knows that \u201cit will end with us still standing here defending\u201d life in Ukraine.Nobody knows for certain where Mr Putin was when his army attacked Ukraine. But Mr Zelensky was at home with his wife and his two children. It was they who woke him up early on February 24th. \u201cThey told me there were loud explosions. After a couple of minutes, I received the signal that a rocket attack was under way.\u201d Soon after the invasion began, America offered him a passage to safety. He chose to stay.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being brave,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to act the way I do.\u201d He did not prepare for the role of war hero. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know how to do something this way or that way, be honest and that\u2019s it. You have to be honest, so that people believe you. You don\u2019t need to try. You need to be yourself\u2026And it\u2019s important not to show that you are better than who you are.\u201dIn Mr Putin\u2019s world honesty is weakness. His power is based on secrecy and deception. Mystery and violence fuel his cult of authority.

Built in 1810-11, it was one of the city\u2019s most imposing buildings before it was destroyed by a fire in 1930. When it was rebuilt, architects opted for a Gothic style, with vaulted stone ceilings and exquisite stained-glass windows. But in 1995 the congregation was dissolved and the property fell into disrepair. In 2019 the edifice was resurrected once again, this time as the \u201cInnovation Cathedral\u201d for Audible, an audiobook and podcast firm. The historic site is now an office for hundreds of Audible employees. In some ways the new building, as a combination of old forms and modern sensibilities, is an apt visual metaphor for the audiobook itself. \u201cTalking Book\u201d programmes were first developed nearly a century ago, in the 1930s, when both the American Foundation for the Blind and the Royal National Institute of Blind People in Britain recognised that such diversions might help soldiers who had been visually impaired in the first world war. Early recordings included passages from the Bible and Shakespeare\u2019s plays. Since then, audiobooks have passed from vinyl to cassette to CD and to digital files. They are increasingly experimental in form as well as content. The sector enjoyed double-digit annual growth in sales between 2011 and 2020 in America and between 2014 and 2020 in Britain. (Figures for 2021 have not yet been released.) In 2020 there was a 39% year-on-year increase in the number of audiobooks published in America. Publishers suggest the pandemic has bolstered this increasing popularity, as a form of entertainment that is readily available at home yet doesn\u2019t require screen time. Audible, which reaches 180 countries, says it saw a 25% spike in listening hours between 2020 and 2021, to a total listening time of 3.4bn hours. The format is appealing to new demographic groups, too, including younger male listeners\u2014whom the publishing industry has traditionally found it hard to engage. Celebrity narrators have played a role in audiobooks\u2019 popularity. Elisabeth Moss, star of the hit television series \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d, lent her voice to an audiobook recording of Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel. Richard Armitage has recently narrated \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d and Thandiwe Newton bravely took on 60 hours of \u201cWar and Peace\u201d. But producers have become bolder, too. Historically, publishers had a clear idea of what would make for a good audiobook (usually crime capers, family sagas and star autobiographies). Now, according to Richard Lennon, audio publisher at Penguin Random House, \u201calmost anything is up for discussion\u201d.Charlie Mackesy\u2019s hit book, \u201cThe Boy, The Mole, The Fox and the Horse\u201d, was an interesting challenge as an illustrated volume with few words. When it was adapted, the dialogue was developed and descriptions of each drawing were provided; lilting music by Max Richter and Isobel Waller-Bridge provides an accompaniment. Mr Mackesy describes the experience of listening to it as like \u201cseeing with your ears\u201d. An audio version of \u201cThe Lost Words\u201d, a nature book by Robert Macfarlane and Jackie Morris, used field recordings to complement its poems, rather than the drawings in the original publication.Clever sound design can also mimic the subjectivity of perspective in novels and other forms of writing. In \u201cDescent\u201d, a haunting play developed for Audible, the listener can, like the protagonist, hear things the other characters cannot. This creates what Natalie Abrahami, the director, describes as \u201cthe sense of the paranormal being normal to the person who\u2019s experiencing it\u201d. In \u201cSour Hall\u201d\u2014another Audible production\u2014a short story by Naomi Booth is adapted by Laura Kirwan-Ashman into an immersive six-part horror series. Both works were made using binaural recording techniques, which produce the effect of 360-degree sound, especially when heard through headphones. The innovative audiobooks of recent years reflect an increasingly open approach to genre and the boundaries between audio and print. James Felton\u2019s \u201cThe Year That Was 2021\u201d, a witty recap of the year\u2019s news stories, was released by Hachette in December in an audio-only format. Rumaan Alam\u2019s \u201cThere Are Flowers in Ohio: A Short Story\u201d was written specifically for audio as part of Audible\u2019s \u201cOriginal Stories\u201d collection. Hosting audiobooks alongside other content, Audible blurs the lines between audiobook and podcast, audiobook and audio drama, and even between audio and theatre (one initiative involves staging productions off-Broadway before recording them; another works with young British playwrights via the National Theatre). A future development will be audiobooks created with the help of artificial intelligence. Companies including Speechki and DeepZen are developing synthetic narration as a cheaper, faster alternative to human-narrated books. Speechki has voices in 77 languages; DeepZen has licensed the voice of Edward Herrmann, an actor who died in 2014, and is using it to create new audiobooks. Arguing that only a small percentage of the books printed each year are turned into audiobooks, Speechki claims that synthetic voiceovers provide publishers with cost-effective ways to produce their backlist and could prove particularly useful for technical or academic books. Hachette says it is investigating AI narration for some titles.Publishers emphasise the continued value of the customary audiobook, read by a single narrator, as well as its appeal to listeners. (Many youngish adults recall with fondness Stephen Fry\u2019s rendition of the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d books.) Yet the reason modern iterations impress is that they draw from a well of 21st-century technological innovation and creativity alongside a venerable tradition of oral storytelling.

Two days later he submitted a budget to Congress that included $813bn in defence spending. He called it \u201cone of the largest investments in our national security in history\u201d.The administration\u2019s numbers may not match its rhetoric. America\u2019s defence budget accounts for a whopping 40% of global military expenditures. But the proposed additional spending of $17bn above the total of $796bn expected this year represents an increase of only 2%.That is lower than the budget\u2019s projected rate of inflation of about 2.5%, which some economists think is optimistic, given the pace of price rises so far this year. The administration prefers to highlight the 4% increase in the base budget for the Department of Defence. The department\u2019s budget excludes such things as spending on nuclear warheads by the Department of Energy, and supplemental outlays (for example, to help Ukraine and resettle Afghans who worked with America).\u201cThis is going to be a real-terms cut in defence spending,\u201d says Todd Harrison of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington, . He predicts that Congress, which can modify the president\u2019s request, will add a hefty slice of extra spending\u2014perhaps another $30bn\u2014just as it did for the current year. \u201cThe politics on the defence budget have really changed substantially in the past two months. A year ago, we were hearing progressives in the Democratic Party talk about trying to cut the defence budget by 10%. Those calls have gone silent.\u201dAs a share of , defence spending has in fact fallen over the years, from 4.7% in 2010 to about 3.2% this year. The navy\u2019s fleet is set to shrink. And a nuclear-capable sea-launched cruise missile is being cancelled. Leading Republicans have called for a budget that adds 5% above inflation. If, as seems likely, they take control of one or both houses of Congress in this year\u2019s mid-term elections, they will have the clout to push for bigger increases.The president\u2019s request is something of a muddle. Although issued late, it does not take account of money that Congress recently agreed to spend, not least on Ukraine. Officials acknowledge that it may have to be reviewed later in the year. What is more, the request was not preceded, as was expected, by the publication of a national-security strategy.Officials insist that the war in Ukraine has not changed their underlying analysis: Russia presents an acute menace and China is the longer-term challenge. Over the years the breakdown of spending has shifted from the army to the navy and especially the air force\u2014a trend that continues in the president\u2019s request\u2014to strengthen the latter two in Asia in particular.And a growing share, an extra 9.5%, has gone to \u201cresearch, development, test, and evaluation\u201d, not least in artificial intelligence. This helps to maintain America\u2019s military edge in the long term, but generates little new capability in the meantime. That suggests the administration does not think it will be at war with China soon, despite the warnings of some commanders that China could try to invade Taiwan before the end of the decade.

He can be an impressive orator. After a well-judged speech to a Ukrainian church in London, congregants rose to their feet and chanted \u201cThank you!\u201d, tears on their cheeks.Mr Johnson needed a boost from somewhere. In January he faced being kicked out of office in a parliamentary rebellion after it emerged that raucous parties were held in Downing Street during covid-19 lockdowns. His approval ratings fell to the lowest of any prime minister since John Major in 1994. On March 29th he hosted a kiss-and-make-up dinner for Tory s at the Park Plaza, a hotel across the Thames from Parliament. There, he laughed off the letters of no confidence his opponents had sent seeking to trigger a leadership ballot, declaring that if Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, had to face anything similar, he would not be so \u201cdeluded and isolated\u201d.Mr Johnson had similarly indulged Tory solipsism in a speech on March 19th to the party\u2019s spring conference in Blackpool, likening Ukraine\u2019s struggle for freedom with Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. (This made sense to those Conservatives who regard the  as a tyranny; many Ukrainians found it gravely offensive.) Referring to the Labour Party, he asked: \u201cDo we want them running up the white flag? Do you see them standing up to Putin\u2019s blackmail?\u201d (For his part Sir Keir Starmer, Labour\u2019s leader, has used the crisis to stress his commitment to  membership.) The Conservative Party\u2019s head office has produced jaunty Instagram graphics about the anti-tank missiles sent to Ukraine, emblazoned with the party logo.Some Tory s suggest that the Ukraine conflict could give Mr Johnson a bounce to rival that enjoyed by Margaret Thatcher after her quick and decisive victory in the . That appears fanciful. But the prime minister\u2019s position does seem more secure, in part because of such jingoism. Several s who wrote letters calling for a no-confidence vote have withdrawn them, declaring that a war is no time for a leadership contest. His net approval rating has recovered somewhat, rising to -33 from a nadir of -51 in mid-January. Voters overwhelmingly support arming Ukraine. The Tories\u2019 gap with the Labour Party has narrowed.Equally important for Mr Johnson\u2019s job security is that Rishi Sunak, his chancellor and chief rival, has faltered. A budget update on March 23rd was widely criticised for doing too little to ease the impact of a squeeze on household incomes. The coming year will be painful: state benefits will fall by almost 5% in real terms and energy bills are expected to rise by a total of 130%.A series of inept public appearances have confirmed Tory s\u2019 suspicions that, despite a slick start, Mr Sunak is too inexperienced for the top job. Asked the price of a loaf of bread\u2014a standard interview question used to probe ministers\u2019 understanding of the hard-pressed worker\u2014he replied: \u201cWe all have different breads in my house.\u201d The Labour Party intends to exploit Mr Sunak\u2019s prudence, or tightfistedness, in order to claim that the government\u2019s pre-election promises in 2019 of largesse for poor constituencies count for nothing.This is all good for Mr Johnson\u2019s short-term survival, which depends on his party. But it is bad for his party\u2019s prospects, which depend on voters. Meanwhile the scandal over lockdown parties is flaring up again. On March 29th the Metropolitan Police announced it would issue 20 fines. The force has refused to name recipients, but Downing Street said that if Mr Johnson were to be handed one, that would be made public. He would then face renewed calls to quit\u2014which he would surely face down.

By using these to track the locations of, and conditions experienced by, those containers, and transmitting that information back to the people who need to know via satellite when a container is at sea and via a mobile-phone network when it is in port or on land, he believes firms will be able to maximise the efficiency of supply chains.And supply-chain oversight is but one of the benefits small, remotely connected sensors can bring. People already interact with many of them\u2014sometimes knowingly, such as those in smart watches, sometime less so, such as those which regulate temperature and lighting in their offices. Some folk, indeed, talk grandly of the result being an interconnected network akin to an \u201cinternet of things\u201d (o).Whether or not that comes to pass, there will be a lot more such sensors in the future. In 2017, researchers at , a chipmaker, predicted that the world would have a trillion of them by 2035. Even more sober estimates run into the tens or hundreds of billions. And they will all need power. Lest battery-makers start rubbing their hands in glee at this new market, though, Mr Fitzgerald, and others like him, have a different idea. Their version of this future will not be battery powered. Instead, the sensors populating it will scavenge for a living.Net Feasa is building sensors to do just that. They are powered by vibrations, heat and light, using technology developed in collaboration with Mike Hayes of the Tyndall National Institute, in Cork. The electricity thus generated is then stored in devices called supercapacitors, whence it is instantly available. Only in case of dire energy starvation need the system call on the backup battery installed in it. As a consequence, that battery should never need replacement. All of this is packed into a device a few centimetres across, which is designed to fit unobtrusively on a shipping container\u2019s doors. And these devices are already proving themselves in early trials.Net Feasa is not alone. Sensors that draw power from the environment, either to supplement a battery or to replace it, are starting to spread. Managers at EnOcean, a German company that is one of the leading firms in the field, estimate that some 20m of the firm\u2019s products have been installed in a million buildings around the world.The most advanced are those that use light. Their power-packs are similar to solar cells, but are adjusted to cope with the fact that the artificial interior lighting they are scavenging is both weaker than sunlight and of a different colour. Such photovoltaic sensors are used to measure levels of illumination, temperature, air pollution and even (of particular interest at the moment) airborne pathogens. Automatic systems fed these data can then adjust lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning levels appropriately.Photovoltaic sensors can also track products on assembly lines and monitor quality during manufacture. They offer eyes and ears in sterile chambers and provide early warning of shortages or leaks. They generate vast quantities of data as well, which can be used to maximise efficiency\u2014though firms that employ them in this way tend to be secretive about the details. A study published in 2019 on the industrial applications of all sensor types in Germany, Switzerland and Austria by , a consultancy, estimated the combined boost to revenue from their extensive deployment could be as high as 34%, depending on the sector involved.Obviously, photovoltaic harvesting has restrictions, for it is suitable only in places where the lights are usually on. That works for offices and those parts of factories where people operate. But for many industrial applications, especially those being carried out in the dark, a more useful source of scavenged energy is heat. The trick of turning this into electricity was discovered two centuries ago, and has been improving ever since. It usually involves a device called a thermocouple, made of sheets of two appropriate materials laid face to face. When one side is hotter than the other, electrons move between the sheets, generating a current.One firm which makes energy-harvesters that work this way is Perpetua Power, in Oregon. Its devices are designed for inaccessible locations where battery replacement would be impractical. Perpetua\u2019s sensors have been installed on oil wells in the freezing conditions of Alaska and the desert heat of California, to measure the pressure at the well heads. They have, as well, been fitted to steam-flow gauges under the streets of New York, to make sure customers are billed correctly for their use of the city\u2019s district-heating system., a Swedish-Swiss firm, also makes temperature sensors that rely on thermoelectric harvesting. Customers in the food industry use it to ensure ovens are sufficiently hot, while owners of industrial plants can check their cooling systems are working properly. And thermal harvesters can even be embedded in the concrete foundations of buildings, or affixed to internal beams, to flag up structural weaknesses and mechanical problems.Another field in which energy-scavenging sensors are being deployed is transport. It is here that vibrations and movement come into their own. Perpetuum, a firm spun out of the University of Southampton, in Britain, in 2004, and bought in 2021 by Hitachi Rail, designs sensors powered by piezoelectricity. This is a phenomenon whereby certain materials generate current when stressed or deformed. Perpetuum\u2019s products monitor the condition of railway rolling stock\u2014an abundant source of vibration. Sensors installed in wheels, gearboxes and motors are able to assess those components\u2019 health by looking out for thermal and vibrational telltales of mechanical defects. They can also watch the condition of the track. Several countries\u2019 railway networks make use of them to varying degrees, including those of America, Australia and India.ReVibe Energy, a Swedish firm, has similar aims. Its sensors, which rely on electromagnetic induction rather than piezoelectricity to convert vibrations into energy, can be fixed to carriage wheels to monitor their position as well as the stresses on their bearings. ReVibe\u2019s technology is being applied to mining as well, to look out for unusual patterns of movement in machines involved in the crushing and transport of aggregates.There is also one further source of movement, which might be exploited to run sensors. This is the human body itself, which it is becoming increasingly fashionable to adorn with sensors. A plausible way to convert body-movement into electricity is to employ devices called triboelectric nanogenerators (s). These convert friction into electricity using a method that goes back at least as far as the Ancient Greeks, namely rubbing together two so-called triboelectric materials (amber, the Greek word for which is , and wool were once popular) to create a static charge. s turn this party trick into a useful resource by conducting the charge so generated away as a current.s, invented a mere decade ago, might plausibly be incorporated into sensors attached to human bodies or clothing. Bodies are continuous generators of motion, whether from breathing, gesticulating or running for a bus. The flexibility of many triboelectric materials makes them ideal for sewing into fabrics, where they could harvest the body\u2019s movement in order to power sensors that monitored vital statistics such as breathing and pulse rate during exercise. Such sensors might also do well in the hands of clever marketing types, with the phrase \u201cbatteries not included\u201d being not a warning but a boast.

The guessing game has at the same time raised Russian hopes of Indian support, Chinese hopes of wooing India from the clutches of America, Western hopes that India may dump its crotchety old friend Russia\u2014and Western worries that a country they see as a natural ally couldn\u2019t, in fact, give a fig about their high-falutin\u2019 self-declared values, and is solely focused on a narrow notion of its own interests. On every vote at the UN since Russia\u2019s tanks rolled into Ukraine on February 24th, India has abstained. It has not condemned Russia by name. But nor has it shied from calling this a war rather than a \u201cspecial operation\u201d, as Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s deadpan foreign minister, gamely corrected an Indian journalist in Delhi on April 1st. Russia\u2019s state-throttled media tries to paint India as a staunch cheerleader of Vladimir Putin, but struggles to find pukka Indians to parrot such tosh. And although India has annoyed those hoping to squash Russia with sanctions, by  and other goods, Mr Jaishankar points out that Western countries still buy heaps more Russian stuff than India ever has or will.This prickly damn-them-all attitude is popular in India. In the polarised politics generated by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) strident Hindu nationalism, giving the West a poke in the eye unites in delight both old leftists and young Hindutva hotheads. Mr Jaishankar was also not wrong when he told a perplexed-looking Liz Truss, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, that Indians care less about Ukraine than they do, say, about Afghanistan simply because of proximity. The subtle message was, first, that Ukraine is Europe\u2019s problem and, second, that the West let India down by scuttling Afghanistan to the Taliban, so why should India be concerned now? India\u2019s press and social media tom-tommed umbrage when Daleep Singh, America\u2019s deputy national security adviser for economic affairs, suggested there might be \u201cconsequences\u201d for undermining efforts to squeeze Russia. India will never bow to pressure, was the responding chorus.While much of India\u2019s establishment does cherish musty memories of cold-war \u201cnon-alignment\u201d, when the Soviet Union backed the country against an American-supported Pakistan and a looming Chinese dragon, many also cite pragmatic contemporary reasons for staying off the West\u2019s anti-Putin bandwagon. Most obviously, India depends on Russia for most of its arms. Perhaps 80% of its legacy systems are of Russian origin and, despite intensifying efforts to diversify, Russia remains a key supplier of new weapons and a vital source for maintenance and spares. Perhaps more crucially in the eyes of Indian generals, many of the country\u2019s prestige military toys, such as nuclear-powered submarines and hypersonic cruise missiles, rely on Russian inputs. It is not just nostalgia, either, that attaches Indian strategists to a clumsy fading power whose economy is now little more than half of India\u2019s in size. Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, an American think-tank, notes that India still sees Russia through the lens of its biggest long-term foreign-policy challenge, China. Delhi warmed to Moscow in the 1960s after the Soviet Union broke with Beijing. Indian security wonks still see Mr Putin\u2019s Russia as a potential balance to what is not only an Asian superpower, but one with which India regularly spars over a long and dangerously undefined border. India fears that an isolated Russia will fall deeper into China\u2019s embrace. At the same time, by declining to condemn Russia over Ukraine, India also wants to send a signal to China of its independence. The message is that for all its military footsie with the West, such as joining a \u201cQuad\u201d of China-wary powers along with America, Japan and Australia, carrying out joint naval exercises and mouthing mantras about a \u201crules-based order\u201d and \u201cfree and open Indo-Pacific\u201d, India is not a Western stooge.All this posturing is fine, say Western diplomats, swallowing yet another snub on April 1st when Narendra Modi, India\u2019s prime minister, granted an audience to Mr Lavrov that he had pointedly denied to any of the other envoys (including China\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, who visited Delhi on March 25th). Even the Americans accept that in a global energy crunch India may take some advantage of steep Russian discounts on its oil. They have already given Delhi a free pass for its recent purchase of an advanced Russian air-defence system\u2014the sort of order that could trigger American laws requiring sanctions. But although India may be right in thinking that it is too big and important a player for Western powers to forsake, Delhi\u2019s narrow focus on \u201crealpolitik\u201d is not without costs. China\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d claims on bits of Indian territory are not so different from Russia\u2019s in Ukraine. Cocking a snook at your partners in the Quad serves only to prove Mr Wang, the Chinese foreign minister, acute in his argument that the grouping is no more substantial than \u201csea foam\u201d. Clever as it may seem to use its closeness to Russia to its advantage in its contest with China, the erratic, bumbling and nasty Russia of Mr Putin, provider of costly weapons that don\u2019t work too well, does not a reliable partner make. And at some point, particularly if Ukraine gets even messier, India\u2019s own people might begin to take unwonted interest in foreign affairs. They might then ask, what kind of democracy are we anyway, if we can\u2019t help fellow democracies in need?

The chorus of the Odessa opera performs Verdi in the open air. The clips of Ukrainians making music in adversity are among the war\u2019s most poignant: the melodies seem at once ephemeral and indomitable, ordinary and defiant. In one video, a stubbly man in a hoodie sings for an entranced crowd taking shelter in Kharkiv\u2019s metro. Gradually the listeners join in, as if in a rite.The figure with the gravelly, soulful voice is Sviatoslav Vakarchuk, known as Slava, the frontman of Okean Elzy (Ocean of Elza), Ukraine\u2019s most popular rock band, which he co-founded in 1994. \u201cSometimes I sing,\u201d he says of the visits he is making to hospitals, wounded soldiers and refugee centres from Kharkiv to Lviv. Sometimes he just talks. Some onlookers are fans, others simply buoyed by seeing a celebrity\u2014Mr Vakarchuk is the Ukrainian equivalent of Bono or Bruce Springsteen\u2014in a dangerous place.He is one of the many Ukrainian actors, musicians and dancers to have joined the war effort. Several have been wounded or killed. He doesn\u2019t consider himself a hero: \u201cI\u2019m not Mel Gibson in \u2018Braveheart\u2019.\u201d Everyone knows fear, he says, but you do what you can \u201cto make the victory closer\u201d. In his case, signing up to the army has let him criss-cross his embattled country with his guitar.Mr Vakarchuk is not a regular soldier, but nor is he a regular rock star. He has a h in theoretical physics. In 2005 he won the jackpot on Ukraine\u2019s version of \u201cWho Wants to be a Millionaire?\u201d and donated the prize to orphanages. He has done stints at Stanford and Yale, and two as an , on the second occasion launching his own party, both times surmising that parliament was not for him.Rock\u2019n\u2019roll has often been politics by other means. During the Orange revolution of 2004, when protests overturned a rigged election, Okean Elzy played sets on Independence Square to keep morale and the numbers up. \u201cRise up, my darling!\u201d Mr Vakarchuk sang, bouncing on the stage as a gentle snow fell. \u201cYour land is waiting.\u201d That track rose up again during the revolution of 2013-14, along with \u201cWithout a Fight\u201d, a love song repurposed as a resistance tune. Off-stage he strove to halt the ensuing violence. Escalating tragically from peaceful to bloodstained uprisings, then to this invasion, these three events\u2014in all of which Mr Vakarchuk has played a role\u2014are, he reckons, part of a single struggle for independence.These days the Okean Elzy song people most want to hear is, consolingly, \u201cEverything Will Be Alright\u201d. But a hit of 2015 that decried the Kremlin-backed conflict in the Donbas, \u201cNot Your War\u201d, is in demand too. How many more children, it asks, will you lose in someone else\u2019s war? The tendency of his lyrics to chime with current events has led some to take him for \u201can oracle\u201d, Mr Vakarchuk says. Perhaps it\u2019s a gift, he speculates, or a coincidence, or just a form of wishful thinking.For Ukrainians, after all, artists have always carried a special burden. For generations, their sense of nationhood rested more on bards\u2014above all Taras Shevchenko, a revered 19th-century poet\u2014than on politicians. Misrule since independence in 1991 has meant stars like Mr Vakarchuk have again embodied the country\u2019s yearnings. \u201cCulture is the best cement\u201d while a true political nation is evolving, he comments, but afterwards symbolic figureheads are no longer needed. Artists can just be artists.Amid the agony, the war is accelerating that process, rallying Ukrainians around the values of \u201cdignity and freedom\u201d, as he puts it. As for the aggressor: in the past Okean Elzy played in arenas and stadiums in Russia, hoping to improve relations and showcase Ukraine\u2019s culture. But it stopped going after Crimea was annexed, resolving not to return until \u201cthere is a new Russia and our territory comes back\u201d. Now things are grimly \u201cblack and white\u201d, and Russians who back their murderous army, or keep silent, have become \u201cour enemy\u201d.Music is part of war\u2014national anthems, marching songs, battle hymns, ballads of loss and longing\u2014yet also its opposite, as creation is to destruction. There is never much time for songwriting on the road, Mr Vakarchuk says, let alone on his emergency solo tour. But he has written a poem: \u201cWhere have you come from, my hatred?\u201d He has never hated anyone before and hopes the feeling will pass when the war is won. And he has made a recording, a cover of \u201cYou Are So Beautiful\u201d, accompanying himself on the piano. \u201cThe beautiful woman I am singing to\u201d, he says, \u201cis Ukraine.\u201d", "url": "https://www.economist.com/culture/ukraines-most-famous-rock-star-is-singing-for-victory/21808451", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T09:39:36Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/03/articles/main/20220402_cup502.jpg"},

When she was nominated as secretary of state by President Bill Clinton in 1996 she wore a bright red outfit and a pearl necklace with an eagle pendant, both of which advertised her pride and joy far better than boring black could.Her brooches and pins were another subtle gambit men did not have. She took up this delightful pastime when she was America\u2019s ambassador to the  from 1993 to 1997: at first the only woman on the Security Council, one skirt among 14 suits. On happy days she wore flowers, butterflies or balloons; on bad days, crabs and carnivores. When the Iraqis called her an \u201cunparalleled serpent\u201d, a tag she revelled in, she pinned on a snake. When the Russians wired her conference room she wore a huge bug, just to let them know she knew. If she wanted to divert press interest from delicate talks, she sported a mushroom pin to make the point that some things did better in the dark.Nonetheless, she also keenly felt a woman\u2019s disadvantages. As professor of diplomacy at Georgetown University she urged her female students to interrupt and speak up, but she herself sometimes felt a squirm of fear when she butted into a debate among men. Inevitably career and family clashed, too. Even as she accumulated degrees and expertise, she wanted to be a good mother and a dutiful wife. When her husband, Joseph Albright, the scion of a wealthy newspaper family, left her in her 40s, calling her too old-looking, she wanted him back so badly that she was prepared to abandon any thought of a career.In the end, however, that career saved her. The world, its troubles and their possible solutions were utterly absorbing; she could have stayed at Foggy Bottom for ever. In a sense, she had already been trained for it. Her father, her chief model and adviser, had been the Czech ambassador in Belgrade; the family had been forced first by Nazis and then by Communists to abandon Czechoslovakia and make their way, slowly, to America. They arrived in 1948, when she was 11 and, already, a citizen of the world. She worked hard at becoming \u201cthoroughly American Maddy\u201d, until she dreaded that her parents might do something European in front of her friends, such as serving cabbage rolls or singing Slovak songs. America was a haven of peace, democracy and freedom which she keenly embraced and never took for granted.Her approach to foreign policy flowed naturally from this. She wanted to give freedom and democracy to everyone. Yet America\u2019s power to lead was so morally important that it could not be squandered on risky enterprises. As secretary of state she fostered European alliances that could carry some of the burden, and expanded \u2019s umbrella to cover the new democracies emerging from the Soviet rubble. (Eastward expansion was a step towards Russia, she insisted, not against it.) Her loathing for Donald Trump, when he appeared, was part-based on his disdain for these alliances, which included the places of her past.Her years at the State Department, from 1997 to 2001, were relatively quiet. It had not been so at the  where Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia were all traumatic for her. In Somalia, where anarchy reigned, America sent in troops to feed the hungry but, when 18 were killed, felt humiliated and withdrew. In Bosnia, convulsed with ethnic cleansing, America stood by for far too long until limited  air strikes cleared the way for a negotiated peace. As for Rwanda, it exploded in 1994 with such volcanic intensity that she received no intelligence and nothing could be done. She argued hard for humanitarian aid but it was too late even for that, and no one, least of all Congress, seemed to care. Working at the  left her in two minds: first, that it was wonderful that such a body existed; but second, that it was a monstrous bureaucracy which, while people were dying, argued over commas.Failure in Rwanda was her deepest regret. Having huddled through the London Blitz, she knew something of war, but not like this: children\u2019s skulls gouged by machetes, stadiums carpeted with blood. Another vivid cause for regret was her remark on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that the deaths of half a million Iraqi children, supposedly caused by the sanctions placed on Saddam Hussein for blocking  nuclear inspections, were a price worth paying. The figures turned out to be false, but she hated to appear so cruel.The fighting in Yugoslavia touched her most closely. First, she had lived there. But second, it raised again the spectre of concentration camps in Europe, into which Muslim men and boys were herded to be starved or killed by Serbs. By that date she had also learned, to her horror, that 26 members of her own family had been murdered in Terezin and Auschwitz, including three grandparents. She found two of their names on the wall of the Pinkas synagogue in Prague, which she had visited before without knowing. Her parents had wiped that Jewish heritage away, and had her baptised a Catholic, in order to escape such persecution.She accepted this astonishing truth just after becoming secretary of state. It shocked her, but she stayed an Episcopalian, as she had become to marry Joe, and did not exploit her new identity. Her overwhelming response was to praise and defend what her parents had done for her. Yes, they had lied, and had deprived her of part of herself. But they had enabled her to live, succeed and be an American, the luckiest thing in the world.

The  has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia, which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year, by two-thirds by the end of 2022. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, dreams that the  can \u201cget rid\u201d of Russian imports entirely within a few years. Can America, one of the world\u2019s largest natural-gas exporters, help fill the gap?When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy by implementing policies to import more liquefied natural gas () from America\u2014which it dubbed \u201cmolecules of freedom\u201d\u2014the proposal was ridiculed. Yet President Joe Biden finds himself doing something very similar to his predecessor. On March 25th he and Ms von der Leyen announced a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d plan to help end the \u2019s reliance on Russian gas. It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of  for Europe this year (equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021). It also promises to \u201censure additional  market demand\u201d for 50bn cubic metres per year of the fuel from America by 2030.Industry insiders have greeted the ambitious plan with scepticism. One reason is that American gas companies face severe infrastructure constraints. The share of American exports going to Europe shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year (equivalent to 22bn cubic metres), as prices soared on the continent. America \u201chas almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use\u201d, reckons Rystad, a research firm, meaning that \u201cthere is no additional  to be exported\u201d in the short term. Jack Fusco, boss of Cheniere, a big American energy company, confirms that his firm is \u201cmaxed out\u201d. It would take four or five years and tens of billions of dollars in investment, not to mention the fast-tracking of regulatory approvals, to change that.There are also questions about whether the  has the infrastructure to cope with the imports. Receiving cargoes of  and converting them into usable natural gas requires big facilities for regasification. Europe has spare capacity, but much of it is on the coasts of western countries like Spain and France. Poor interconnections mean that these are not very useful in getting imports to eastern parts of the , where an embargo would hit hardest. Germany, which has no  terminals, has vowed to build two, but that will take several years. Some European countries talk of acquiring floating  terminals, which can be set up more quickly\u2014but there is a severe global shortage of them.Look to the longer term, though, and the new approach to natural gas shows more promise. That is because the  appears ready to jettison its misguided hostility to long-term gas contracts, which it had discouraged as part of its effort to boost spot markets for gas. The intent had been to promote competition, but, as last winter\u2019s rocketing gas prices revealed, it also left Europe badly exposed to a supply shock. As a top American  exporter explains, Europe focused on expanding the spot market when it should have secured \u201cfantastic\u201d long-term pricing instead.Now the commission says it will encourage long-term contracts \u201cto support final investment decisions on both  export and import infrastructure\u201d. That should give investors in American export facilities the confidence to spend the billions required, boosting transatlantic trade. Giles Farrer of Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy, reckons that the infrastructure needed to achieve the aim of 50bn cubic metres of liquefaction capacity in America would cost roughly $25bn, not including upstream investments and supply-chain inflation. Rystad thinks the spending needed to meet Europe\u2019s extra demand could be in the region of $35bn.Diversification away from Russia in the long term, then, may be possible. But that does little to help with the short-term problem of an aggressive Mr Putin. A rational calculus suggests that he should be unwilling to turn off the taps, considering he profits handsomely from high prices. Energy Intelligence, an industry publisher, reckons Gazprom earned $20.5bn from European gas sales in the first two months of the year, nearly as much as it made from Europe in all of 2020. But few observers would dare to predict the actions of an increasingly erratic dictator.

Headlines about crimes committed by Floridians, sometimes involving alligators, alcohol, or a combination of the two, have contributed to a wacky \u201cFlorida man\u201d stereotype. Many associate Florida with retirement, rednecks and a world-famous rodent, Mickey Mouse.In fact, Florida has become emblematic of much of America and central to all of it. The state is on the rise, as our  this week explains. Between 2010 and 2020 its population grew at double the national rate. Florida has overtaken New York to become America\u2019s third-most-populous state after California and Texas, with a dynamic and diverse demography, including fast-rising numbers of Hispanics. It is now the number-one destination for American and foreign movers. In the year to July 31st 2021, 260,000 more people arrived in Florida than left\u2014equivalent to adding a city the size of Buffalo, New York.Its economic and political heft is growing, too. Florida\u2019s  has doubled since 2002. Were it a country, it would rank as the 15th-largest economy in the world, ahead of Mexico and Indonesia. Having recently gained a 30th electoral-college vote, it has more than a tenth of those required to win the presidency. The largest swing state, in the past 12 presidential elections Florida has voted all but twice for the winner. And as home to musicians, athletes and a recent former president, Florida is a cultural trendsetter, for better or worse, as well as ground zero for the fight over government restrictions related to covid-19.Americans ignore this powerhouse at their peril\u2014and should heed the lessons it holds. For a start, Florida points to the wider looming battle between generations. Its residents include millions of retired Americans who want to limit government spending, even while they use government programmes, such as Medicare, a health-care scheme for the elderly. Younger Floridians, meanwhile, want to see investment in their own future, and are finding cities like Miami increasingly unaffordable.The young are also more affected by the threats Florida faces, nowhere more so than over the environment, Florida\u2019s biggest draw as well as its most acute vulnerability. A fifth of its property is at \u201csubstantial\u201d risk of flooding because of rising sea-levels. Its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, was elected as an environmentalist and has invested in programmes that fund cities\u2019 \u201cresilience\u201d, but the state needs to do much more. Florida has a chance to serve as an inspiration for how to mitigate the damage of climate change, but risks becoming a cautionary tale of what happens when a state government does too little, too late.Politically, Florida has come to embody the Republican Party and its rightward tilt. If the Florida-based Donald Trump decides not to run again in 2024, Mr DeSantis is the likeliest Republican nominee for president. The rising number of independents in Florida suggests that people are fed up with both parties. But Democrats look especially vulnerable. A decade ago they claimed 558,000 more registered voters than Republicans; today they trail Republicans by 43,000. Nationally, Democrats need to run more optimistic, centrist candidates who can appeal to independent voters like those in Florida. As it is, they are struggling to shake off the \u201csocialist\u201d label that Republicans have given them, turning off many voters, notably Hispanics.Lastly, Florida offers a case study in economic policy. It charges no income tax, which enhances its appeal, as do the pro-business attitudes of the state\u2019s leaders. The pandemic has prompted people and firms to reconsider where they want to be based, leading many to move out of high-tax, high-regulation states (such as New York and California) to Florida and Texas, which are pro-business and tax-light. Silicon Valley and Wall Street types are attracted to a place where politicians welcome them and never condemn their success.It is neither practical nor desirable for all other states to emulate Florida\u2019s low-tax, low-spend model. But Florida\u2019s success should give pause to states intent on continuing to raise taxes, to enact new regulations and to slander successful businesses. As America\u2019s population peaks, states will compete with each other for people.

It has a history of booms and busts, with an over-reliance on property. It thrives as people move there, yet some of its politicians sound anti-immigrant. It should deal with the rising cost of living and its tired infrastructure. The rightward shift in the legislature is concerning for those who have a broad, and inclusive, interpretation of liberty.

{"title": "Will dollar dominance give way to a multipolar system of currencies?", "content": "IN THE WAKE of an invasion that drew international condemnation, Russian officials panicked that their dollar-denominated assets within America\u2019s reach were at risk of abrupt confiscation, sending them scrambling for alternatives. The invasion in question did not take place in 2022, or even 2014, but in 1956, when Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary.

The invasion in question did not take place in 2022, or even 2014, but in 1956, when Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary. The event is often regarded as one of the factors that helped kick-start the eurodollar market\u2014a network of dollar-denominated deposits held outside America and usually beyond the direct reach of its banking regulators.The irony is that the desire to keep dollars outside America only reinforced the greenback\u2019s heft. As of September, banks based outside the country reported around $17trn in dollar liabilities, twice as much as the equivalent for all the other currencies in the world combined. Although eurodollar deposits are beyond Uncle Sam\u2019s direct control, America can still block a target\u2019s access to the dollar system by making transacting with them illegal, as its latest measures against Russia have done.This fresh outbreak of financial conflict has raised the question of whether the dollar\u2019s dominance has been tarnished, and whether a multipolar currency system will rise instead, with the Chinese yuan playing a bigger role. To understand what the future might look like, it is worth considering how the dollar\u2019s role has evolved over the past two decades. Its supremacy reflects more than the fact that America\u2019s economy is large and its government powerful. The liquidity, flexibility and the reliability of the system have helped, too, and are likely to help sustain its global role. In the few areas where the dollar has lost ground, the characteristics that made it king are still being sought out by holders and users\u2014and do not favour the yuan.Eurodollar deposits illustrate the greenback\u2019s role as a global store of value. But that is not the only thing that makes the dollar a truly international currency. Its role as a unit of account, in the invoicing of the majority of global trade, may be its most overwhelming area of dominance. According to research published by the  in 2020, over half of non-American and non- exports are denominated in dollars. In Asian emerging markets and Latin America the share rises to roughly 75% and almost 100%, respectively. Barring a modest increase in euro invoicing by some European countries that are not part of the currency union, these figures have changed little in the past two decades.Another pillar of the dollar\u2019s dominance is its role in cross-border payments, as a medium of exchange. A lack of natural liquidity for smaller currency pairs means that it often acts as a vehicle currency. A Uruguayan importer might pay a Bangladeshi exporter by changing her peso into dollars, and changing those dollars into taka, rather than converting the currencies directly.So far there has been little shift away from the greenback: in February only one transaction in every five registered by the  messaging system did not have a dollar leg, a figure that has barely changed over the past half-decade. But a drift away is not impossible. Smaller currency pairs could become more liquid, reducing the need for an intermediary. Eswar Prasad of Cornell University argues convincingly that alternative payment networks, like China\u2019s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System, might undermine the greenback\u2019s role. He also suggests that greater use of digital currencies will eventually reduce the need for the dollar. Those developed by central banks in particular could facilitate a direct link between national payment systems.Perhaps the best example in global finance of an area in which the dollar is genuinely and measurably losing ground is central banks\u2019 foreign-exchange reserves. Research published in March by Barry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley, shows how the dollar\u2019s presence in central-bank reserves has declined. Its share slipped from 71% of global reserves in 1999 to 59% in 2021. The phenomenon is widespread across a variety of central banks, and cannot be explained away by movements in exchange rates.The findings reveal something compelling about the dollar\u2019s new competitors. The greenback\u2019s lost share has largely translated into a bigger share for what Mr Eichengreen calls \u201cnon-traditional\u201d reserve currencies. The yuan makes up only a quarter of this group\u2019s share in global reserves. The Australian and Canadian dollars, by comparison, account for 43% of it. And the currencies of Denmark, Norway, South Korea and Sweden make up another 23%. The things that unite those disparate smaller currencies are clear: all are floating and issued by countries with relatively or completely open capital accounts and governed by reliable political systems. The yuan, by contrast, ticks none of those boxes. \u201cEvery reserve currency in history has been a leading democracy with checks and balances,\u201d says Mr Eichengreen.Though the discussion of whether the dollar might be supplanted by the yuan captures the zeitgeist of great-power competition, the reality is more prosaic. Capital markets in countries with predictable legal systems and convertible currencies have deepened, and many offer better risk-adjusted returns than Treasuries. That has allowed reserve managers to diversify without compromising on the tenets that make reserve currencies dependable.Mr Eichengreen\u2019s research also speaks to a plain truth with a broader application: pure economic heft is not nearly enough to build an international currency system. Even where the dollar\u2019s dominance looks most like it is being chipped away, the appetite for the yuan to take even a modest share of its place looks limited. Whether the greenback retains its paramount role in the international monetary system or not, the holders and users of global currencies will continue to prize liquidity, flexibility and reliability. Not every currency can provide them.

Their fame stems not from non-digital pursuits, as was the case with the -list stars who used to dominate the ranks of brand ambassadors, but from savvy use of Instagram, Snapchat or TikTok. Their posts seem frivolous. Their business isn\u2019t.For consumers, influencers are at once a walking advert and a trusted friend. For intermediaries that sit between them and brands, they are a hot commodity. For the brands\u2019 corporate owners, they are becoming a conduit to millennial and Gen- consumers, who will be responsible for 70% of the $350bn or so in global spending on bling by 2025, according to Bain, a consultancy. And for regulators, they are the subject of ever closer scrutiny. On March 29th news reports surfaced that China\u2019s paternalistic authorities are planning new curbs on how much money internet users can spend on tipping their favourite influencers, how much those influencers can earn from fans, and what they are allowed to post. Taken together, all this makes them impossible to ignore.Few reliable estimates exist of the size of the influencer industry. One in 2020 from the National Bureau of Statistics in China, where influencers gained prominence earlier than in the West, estimated its contribution to the economy at $210bn, equivalent to 1.4% of . As with many things digital, the pandemic seems to have given it a fillip, as more people were glued to their smartphones more of the time.EMarketer, a firm of analysts, estimates that 75% of American marketers will spend money on influencers in 2022, up from 65% in 2020 (see chart). Brands\u2019 global spending on influencers may reach $16bn this year, more than one in ten ad dollars spent on social media. Research and Markets, another analysis firm, reckons that in 2021 the middlemen made $10bn in revenues globally, and could be making $85bn by 2028. The ranks of firms offering influencer-related services rose by a quarter last year, to nearly 19,000.The influencer ecosystem is challenging the time-honoured tenets of luxury-brand management. Apart from being one-directional, campaigns have tended to be standardised, unchanging and expensive. An exclusive group of white actresses with the right cheekbones was supposed to signal consistency, as well as opulence. The same smile from the same photograph of the same Hollywood star would entice passers-by to purchase an item for many years. Julia Roberts and Natalie Portman have been the faces of Lanc\u00f4me\u2019s bestselling La Vie est Belle perfume and Miss Dior, respectively, for a decade. Stars and brands alike are tight-lipped about how much money changes hands, but the figures are believed to be in the millions of dollars. One report put the amount spent by  on the entire Miss Dior campaign at \u201cunder $100m\u201d in the past year.Such star-led campaigns can feel aloof to teenagers and 20-somethings who prize authenticity over timeless glamour. And influencers, with their girl- or boy-next-door charm, offer this in spades\u2014for a fraction of the fee of a big-name star. The best ones are able to repackage a brand\u2019s message in a way that is harmonious with their voice, their followers\u2019 tastes and their platform of choice (Instagram is best for all-stars with over 2m followers and TikTok for niche \u201cmicro-influencers\u201d with up to 100,000 followers and \u201cnano-influencers\u201d with fewer than 10,000).Influencers are particularly adept at navigating social-media platforms\u2019 constantly evolving algorithms and features. For example, when Instagram\u2019s algorithm seemed to begin favouring short videos (\u201creels\u201d) over still images, so did many influencers. As social-media apps introduce shopping features, influencers are combining entertainment and direct salesmanship. Such \u201csocial commerce\u201d is huge in China, where it was invented. In October 2021 Li Jiaqi, better known as Lipstick King, notched up nearly 250m views during a 12-hour streaming session in which he peddled everything from lotions to earphones ahead of Singles\u2019 Day, that country\u2019s annual shopping extravaganza. He and Viya, a fellow influencer, flogged $3bn-worth of goods in a day, half as much again as changes hands daily on Amazon.Many influencers manage their production in ways that traditional ambassadors never could. They are video editors, scriptwriters, lighting specialists, directors and the main talent wrapped into one. Jackie Aina, whose beauty tips attract over 7m followers across several platforms, explains the importance of high-quality equipment that can show texture, accurate colour grading\u2014\u201cNot to mention the lighting.\u201d Ms Aina\u2019s 30-second lifestyle TikToks can take hours each to make.This production value, combined with access to the influencers\u2019 audiences, translates into value for the brands. Gauging how much value, precisely, is an inexact science. Launchmetrics, an analytics firm, tries to capture it by tracing a campaign\u2019s visibility across print and online platforms. The resulting \u201cmedia impact value\u201d () reflects how much a brand would need to spend to gain a given degree of exposure\u2014itself indicative of the expected return from a marketing drive. On this measure, which brands use to see how they stack up against rivals, the three-day wedding of Chiara Ferragni, an Italian with 27m Instagram followers, a fondness for pink and a Harvard Business School case study, generated a total of $36m in  for brands including Dior, Prada, Lanc\u00f4me and Alberta Ferretti, which made the bridesmaids\u2019 gowns. That compares with $25m for the more conventional\u2014and almost certainly pricier\u2014video campaign for Louis Vuitton\u2019s autumn/winter 2021 collection for which the fashion house enlisted , a hit South Korean pop group.As well as new opportunities, influencers present new risks, especially for brands whose luxury identities rely on price discipline and exclusivity. Influencer-led live-streamed shopping events in China by Louis Vuitton and Gucci were ridiculed for cheapening their brand. And full-time influencers\u2019 large teams can run up quite a tab. Adam Knight, co-founder of  Global, a marketing agency with offices in London and Shanghai, notes how Lipstick King\u2019s live-streaming success has fuelled demand for his services among brands\u2014but also his own kingly demands. Mr Li\u2019s fees, commissions and exclusive perks only pay for themselves if the event is a smash hit. Otherwise, Mr Knight says, the client\u2019s profit \u201cjust completely erodes\u201d.There are more indirect costs to consider, too. A host of younger and more unpredictable brand ambassadors is harder for brands to control than one or two superstars on exclusive contracts with good-behaviour clauses. Though influencers\u2019 shorter contracts make them easier to replace should they step out of line, untoward antics can be costly. Before the latest clampdown Chinese authorities had already forced 20,000 influencer accounts to be taken down last year on grounds of \u201cpolluting the internet environment\u201d. Luxury brands are reportedly cutting their influencer spending in China in response. Regulators around the world, as well as some social-media platforms, are beginning to clamp down on influencers who do not tag their content as advertorials.Such worries explain why some luxury houses are leery of influencers. Herm\u00e8s, the French purveyor of scarves and Birkin bags, maintains a social-media presence that is conspicuously influencer-free. But more feel the benefits outweigh the costs. Despite Louis Vuitton\u2019s and Gucci\u2019s live-streaming flops,  and Kering, the brands\u2019 respective owners, continue to rely on influencers to create social-media momentum. To be a top-ten brand, says Flavio Cereda-Parini of Jefferies, an investment bank, you have to know how to play the digital game. If you don\u2019t, \u201cyou are not going to be top ten for very long.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/business/2022/04/02/the-business-of-influencing-is-not-frivolous-its-serious", "date_modified": "2022-03-31T16:26:35Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220402_WBD001_0.jpg"},
{"title": "A final victory for China\u2019s propaganda chiefs", "content": "ON A FIRST posting to China, two decades ago, Chaguan covered a disaster that was as grim as it was revealing: an explosion that killed 38 children at a school where pupils were assembling fireworks to pay their fees. Reporting that tragedy in March 2001 was made possible by the courage of bereaved parents in Fanglin, a remote village in the southern province of Jiangxi. To alert national leaders to their plight they accepted interviews and identified local officials and teachers who forced children as young as eight to fit fuses to firecrackers in classrooms. Exposing this crime took bravery by Chinese journalists, too, notably from risk-taking, commercially driven outlets that enjoyed a golden age in the 1990s and early 2000s, protected by well-placed patrons and by the profits that their livelier content generated. \u201cI have to go, a  reporter is here,\u201d a grieving mother said during a telephone interview, naming one of the feistier newspapers of that time. Locals smuggled Chinese journalists into their village, then hid them from thugs sent to beat them. As for Chaguan, he was detained for \u201cillegal reporting\u201d at a police roadblock outside Fanglin. posting to China, two decades ago, Chaguan covered a disaster that was as grim as it was revealing: an explosion that killed 38 children at a school where pupils were assembling fireworks to pay their fees.

Locals smuggled Chinese journalists into their village, then hid them from thugs sent to beat them. As for Chaguan, he was detained for \u201cillegal reporting\u201d at a police roadblock outside Fanglin.An epilogue followed that would be unthinkable now. Days after the blast China\u2019s prime minister, Zhu Rongji, held his annual press conference in Beijing, carried live on television. A Western reporter asked if Mr Zhu stood by his earlier statement blaming the disaster on explosives set off by a deranged villager. Mr Zhu, a gruff economic reformer, acknowledged that foreign and Hong Kong journalists doubted this account. Therefore, he had sent new investigators in plain clothes to Jiangxi: a tacit admission that foreigners might be more reliable than his own bureaucracy. They found that schoolchildren had made fireworks two years previously, but this practice ended before the blast, he said. Declining further debate with \u201csceptical journalists\u201d, foreign or Chinese, Mr Zhu promised that children would be better protected in future. Soon afterwards Jiangxi\u2019s governor and police chief lost their jobs.Jump to the present day and another disaster: the unexplained loss of a China Eastern airliner carrying 132 passengers and crew, seen nosediving vertically from cruising altitude into a hillside in the southern province of Guangxi on March 21st. Public reactions reveal a media landscape transformed. Journalists who rushed to the crash site have been scolded by some internet users for getting in the way, and chided to \u201cwait for the official report\u201d into what happened. A press conference with bosses of China Eastern Airlines was rendered all but useless by cautious questions and scripted answers. A reporter from a foreign news agency, Reuters, stood out for asking about practical matters such as the repair record of the crashed Boeing 737. An airline boss intoned that investigators would \u201ccarry out relevant tasks in an orderly manner\u201d.Today\u2019s leaders do not give credit to foreign reporters for their culture of scepticism. Rather, Western media are accused of inventing reports about repression in Xinjiang or Tibet and of scouring China for negative stories to distract from chaos in America or Europe. When floods hit the central province of Henan in 2021 officials incited crowds of locals to report and harass Western journalists. Presenting the country as under siege by America, nationalist commentators urge citizens to refuse interviews with foreign outlets, rather than \u201chand the West a knife\u201d to stab China. Increasingly, foreigners are called a national-security threat. Cheng Lei, an Australian who worked as an anchor for China\u2019s international television network, , went on trial in Beijing on March 31st, charged with supplying state secrets to a foreign power. Australia\u2019s ambassador was barred from the closed-door hearing.Domestic journalists are under pressure, too. Once there was public sympathy when reporters gave coverage to disaster victims and their families, as they sought answers or redress. Doughty Chinese journalists challenged official cover-ups after an earthquake in Sichuan in 2008, a high-speed train crash in 2011, an explosion in a chemicals depot in Tianjin in 2018 and the start of the covid-19 pandemic in Wuhan in 2020. Now, the public is turning on purveyors of bad news. After the Guangxi plane crash, an unremarkable if mawkish profile of some victims published by magazine attracted a storm of hostile comments and was deleted. In a blog post that went viral, a journalism student called \u2019s writer unethical for interviewing victims\u2019 friends, before primly concluding that disaster coverage should focus on rescue work, not stories of the dead. Netizens condemn journalists and even some victims\u2019 relatives for dwelling too publicly on the tragedy, accusing them of \u201ceating steamed buns dipped in human blood\u201d, a garbled reference to a short story by Lu Xun (a champion of free speech, Lu\u2019s satirical target was actually ignorant superstition).Growing anti-media sentiment is driven by politics and economics. Until about a decade ago, journalists at swashbuckling news outlets talked openly of holding the powerful to account. Then the Communist Party struck back, hard, neutering liberal publications and purging newsrooms. To earn press cards today, journalists must take politics tests and attend 90 hours of training each year, stressing their primary mission of \u201cpublic opinion guidance\". As an extra incentive to toe the party line, censors allow online nationalists to savage any journalism deemed unpatriotic. Nationalist zealots hounding \u201cliberal media\u201d do not realise that \u201cwhat they are attacking is already dead,\u201d says a veteran editor.Meanwhile, commercial pressures drive high-minded outlets to compete with sensationalist \u201cself-media\u201d blogs and videos, to the despair of surviving reporters. That taints the whole industry and boosts the prestige of staid-but-authoritative arms of the state like Xinhua, a news agency, or China Central Television. Today reporters \u201care respected because they are the government, not because they are challenging the government\u201d, sighs the veteran. The China of 2001 might as well be another country.

With the stakes so high, Brazil is on the threshold of a dirty and divisive campaign in which disinformation will be the norm and, some fear, violence a possibility.Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s victory in 2018 was a surprise. Long an obscure backbench congressman, he turned that contest into a referendum on the left-wing Workers\u2019 Party (), which had governed Brazil between 2003 and 2016, and its leader, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who was barred from running by a prison sentence for corruption. Mr Bolsonaro, a former army captain, also won votes by appealing to traditional values, by espousing a harsh line on crime and by exploiting social media. Chance helped, too: he was stabbed by a deranged individual a month before the vote, which brought him sympathy and kept him quiet when he had much to lose by talking.Mr Bolsonaro ended \u201cthe kleptocratic state\u201d and is the \u201cbest president since the military government\u201d of 1964-85, claims Frederico D\u2019Avila, a soya farmer from his party in the state legislature of S\u00e3o Paulo. Mr D\u2019Avila displays a poster in his office extolling Augusto Pinochet, Chile\u2019s former dictator, and Margaret Thatcher, a deregulating British prime minister. He shrugs off the president\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic, which involved denying both the seriousness of covid-19 and the value of vaccines.This is a minority view. Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s approval rating is just 24%. And this time around he is no longer a novelty. Corruption and social conservatism may carry less weight as election issues than in 2018. The president faces an uphill battle against Lula, whose sentence was annulled by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds last year. The latest polls give Lula around 45%. Though many Brazilians would prefer a third option, no other candidate has more than 8%.The election will mainly be about the economy. Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s economy minister, Paulo Guedes, promised privatisations, plus radical reform of taxes and spending. He has achieved little of that. Emergency payments to 68m Brazilians in 2020 helped the economy bounce back from the pandemic. But it has since stalled. Income per person has not increased under Mr Bolsonaro and unemployment stands at 11%, as it did before the pandemic.Ahead of the election, Mr Guedes has abandoned fiscal prudence. The government has cut taxes and is giving a renewed dollop of aid this year to 18m poorer Brazilians. That is a factor in a modest recent rise in Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s support. But inflation, running at 10.5%, is quickly eroding the value of the aid. \u201cThe economy will get worse between now and the election,\u201d thinks Zeina Latif, a consultant.Meanwhile Lula, with no rivals to his left, is moving to the centre. He is poised to name Geraldo Alckmin, a former governor of S\u00e3o Paulo from the centre-right, as his running mate. Investors, disillusioned by Mr Guedes\u2019s failures, are giving Lula the benefit of the doubt, says Ms Latif, recognising his pragmatism.But many analysts expect a closer result than the polls suggest. That is because Lula, skilful politician though he is, has many vulnerabilities as a candidate. He and his party are still associated with corruption in the public mind. Though many poorer Brazilians remember the economic growth and social progress of his presidency in 2003-10, others recall his chosen successor, Dilma Rousseff, driving the country into its deepest slump in a century.Mr Bolsonaro could still win, in other words. But a bigger worry is how he would react to his probable defeat. Imitating Donald Trump, his role model, he has tried to undermine confidence in Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system, despite its impeccable record. He has vowed not to leave quietly. He has many supporters in the police and army; his loosening of gun laws means there are now more firearms in the hands of far-right groups and gun clubs. Degraded though they have been by Mr Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions have survived so far.

By the end of 2021 the government had spent about \u00a3737m ($967m) for the privilege of owning unused personal protective equipment () bought in a panic during the pandemic.

It racked up \u00a3436m in the logistics equivalent of parking tickets\u2014charges for leaving goods in shipping containers because it had nowhere to put them.A report published on March 30th by the National Audit Office, an official spending watchdog, into the government\u2019s purchase of  during the crisis is littered with such horrors. A buying frenzy in spring 2020, as the pandemic let rip, saw it spend about \u00a313bn on 38bn pieces of . By July, the health department realised it had purchased far more than it could possibly use. About 14bn items remain unopened in shipping containers and warehouses. Around 1.5bn of them are likely to pass their expiry date soon and to end up in the bin. Nearly 4bn were never fit for front-line use in the first place, at a cost of roughly \u00a33bn. That is an awful lot of waste, both physical and fiscal.So mistakes were undeniably made, but some were worth making. At the start of the pandemic, the government had to take risks. Countries were fighting over  supplies. \u201cWe had Trump sending the  round trying to gazump everybody on ,\u201d recalled Dominic Cummings, a former aide to the prime minister, before a parliamentary committee in 2021. Meanwhile,  staff were reduced to wearing bin-bags. The price of a surgical gown shot up from \u00a30.33 before the pandemic to \u00a34.50 in the middle of it. In short, all was chaos.The government abandoned caution in response. Usual spending rules were set aside. Officials buying  were exempted from usual procurement rules, with the aim of speeding up the process and avoiding them being outbid by foreign spooks. Due diligence was sometimes replaced by a quick Google, and some suppliers were paid up-front. Predictably, on occasion nothing was received in return. Some  was substandard. About 20% of all orders were expected to be unusable. In the end, the figure was only 11%.In normal times, the government\u2019s problem with risk is aversion rather than addiction. Civil servants can be overcautious, moving slowly to avoid wasting money or having a decision reversed by a judge. Usually, this instinct is healthy. A business can move fast and break things; a government should not. Reversing this principle in the pandemic made sense, despite the sometimes poor results, which were entirely predictable. Business as usual would have meant less money wasted. But it would also have meant less  available, argue the government\u2019s defenders, and potentially more  staff dying.Some mistakes cannot be forgiven so readily, however. The government set up a \u201c  lane\u201d along which suppliers known to ministers or officials were fast-tracked. Chancers claiming to have access to  were splashed across newspapers and then put before ministers, who were desperate both for supply and to avoid negative headlines. \u201cMost of them were full of shit,\u201d says one person involved. It looked like crony capitalism and a court later said the scheme was unlawful. Perhaps worse, it was ineffective. Equipment bought through the usual channels turned out less likely to be defective and more likely to arrive on time. By contrast, the  estimates that a third of spending through the  lane, or roughly \u00a31.4bn, is \u201cat risk\u201d.Memories of the chaos of 2020 are already fading. Labour has attacked the Conservatives over wasteful spending in this period. At the time, however, the government was waging a war against a new and terrifying illness, with the state balance-sheet as a weapon. Gloves and gowns were a fraction of the \u00a3400bn bill for surviving the pandemic. Inevitably not all of it was spent well. John Maynard Keynes summed up a similar situation when describing the British government\u2019s decision to trash its finances to fight the second world war: \u201cWe threw good housekeeping to the wind, but we saved ourselves.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/02/the-british-government-made-mistakes-when-sourcing-protective-gear", "date_modified": "2022-03-31T15:12:20Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/03/articles/main/20220402_brp502.jpg"},

For most of 2021 the central bank said that it had the tools to slow price rises, but saw no need to put them to use. Now investors are coming to terms with the fact that the Fed will have to deploy them at scale. Since March 1st the three-year Treasury yield has risen by more than a percentage point, the biggest absolute change since yields collapsed in January 2008 during the global financial crisis.The move reflects the emergence of expectations that the Fed will increase interest rates by another two percentage points this year, having already raised them by a quarter of a point on March 16th. The impact has been felt worldwide. On March 28th the Bank of Japan promised to buy Japanese government debt in unlimited quantities over four days in order to defend its cap on the ten-year government-bond yield. The yield on ten-year German bunds, which turned positive only in January, now stands at over 0.6%, even as soaring energy prices darken the growth outlook.The most important question for bond investors in America is whether the higher interest rates that are arriving hard and fast can bring about a fabled \u201csoft landing\u201d, in which the heat is taken out of the economy without provoking a recession. Past experience suggests that this will be difficult; tightening has often preceded downturns. Jerome Powell, the Fed\u2019s chairman, has pointed to successful soft landings in 1964, 1984 and 1993. But those comparisons do not account for the difficulty of the present situation. In none of those cases did the Fed let inflation rise as far as it has today.The central bank\u2019s latest projections are rosy, portraying what its critics have dubbed an \u201cimmaculate disinflation\u201d: three years of steadily falling inflation, despite  growth remaining above its long-run trend and both the unemployment rate and the Fed\u2019s policy rate remaining unusually low. Mr Powell may have given up calling inflation \u201ctransitory\u201d, but these forecasts make sense only if inflation goes away of its own accord.It seems likelier that the central bank will have to squeeze inflation out of the economy. Noting that there is no precedent for doing so gracefully, Bill Dudley, a former head of the New York Fed, wrote in a  column on March 29th that a recession was now inevitable. The r-word is also in the air because yields on some short-term bonds have risen above those on longer-term bonds. Such a yield-curve \u201cinversion\u201d suggests that investors expect interest rates to be cut eventually as the economy weakens.An inverted yield curve is often regarded as a sign that markets think the central bank is making a mistake. The uncomfortable truth, however, is that a recession and a mistake are not the same thing if causing a downturn is the only way to restore price stability. In the 1980s Paul Volcker\u2019s Fed vanquished inflation by inducing recessions that pushed the unemployment rate to 10.8%. Nobody accuses it of having done so inadvertently; rather, it chose to pay the high price of disinflation. That is not a position in which today\u2019s central bankers want to be; they talk as much about their duty to support jobs and growth as they do about ensuring stable prices.The good news for Mr Powell is that for all the chatter about the yield curve, investors remain mostly on his side. Most economists put the neutral level of interest rates, at which monetary policy is pressing on neither the accelerator nor the brake, at around 2-2.5%. Both the Fed and the bond market expect the policy rate to overshoot that level only slightly. Rates a notch or two above neutral can hardly be compared with Volcker\u2019s tightening. The market expects immaculacy, too, believing that modestly tight money will be enough to control inflation.The recent predictive record of both central bankers and bond markets has been poor, however. Just a year ago the Fed\u2019s message was that it was not even \u201ctalking about talking about\u201d tightening monetary policy, and investors expected consumer prices to rise by just 2.7% over the following year. If they are caught out again, the Fed could find that meeting its inflation target demands that it induce a recession. The yield curve would then invert more steeply.In that scenario America would pay a dear price for the glacial pace of action in 2021, which was justified, ironically, by the supposed dangers of sudden moves. It has left the central bank, the world economy and asset prices on more perilous ground.:", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/02/can-the-fed-pull-off-an-immaculate-disinflation", "date_modified": "2022-04-01T09:26:22Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220402_FND002_0.jpg"},

Instead, it is one that some Republicans cite as a model: Fidesz in Hungary, led by Viktor Orban, which faces voters on April 3rd.Hungary has a mixed-member parliament. Just over half of s represent geographic districts; the rest come from party lists allocated in proportion to the national vote. Academics often praise this method. But Hungary\u2019s version is warped.First, rather than having independent experts draw districts, Fidesz drew them itself. Legislators in many American states do this, too. But in America, constituencies must have nearly equal numbers of people. In Hungary, by contrast, their populations can vary by up to 35%. This lets the party in power pack opposition voters into a few heavily populated districts, and spread out its own among lots of less-populous ones.Fidesz has deployed this tactic deftly. When it took power in 2010, it fared similarly in the least- and most-populous districts. At the next election in 2014, after it re-drew the borders, its vote share was six percentage points higher in districts with fewer than 70,000 eligible voters than in those with at least 80,000. As a result, Fidesz won 91% of constituency seats and a two-thirds supermajority overall, despite getting just 45% of the vote. In 2018 it won 67% of seats again, with 49% of the vote.This time, Fidesz\u2019s rivals are better organised. Six parties have joined forces as the United Opposition. Had their votes been combined in 2018, Fidesz would have won only 104 of 199 seats. However, many voters who in 2018 backed Jobbik, the only conservative party in the alliance, have defected. As a result, Fidesz leads polls released in March by 50%-44% on average.This lead is too small to ensure that Fidesz will get the most votes. But thanks to gerrymandering, the opposition probably needs 54% of votes to control parliament. Fidesz can hold on with just 43%. By contrast, at the peak of American Republicans\u2019 gerrymandering in 2012, they needed 48% to win the House of Representatives.

They are actually fierce competitors with other invertebrates, voraciously consuming rotting plant matter and tiny organisms such as protists, nematodes, bacteria and fungi, all of which might otherwise sustain a wide variety of soil dwellers.That much is well known, not least from research conducted in northern North America. Here, worms were wiped out during the last ice age, which ended 12,000 years ago. They started returning, in the form of European interlopers, only a few centuries in the past. What have not been investigated much until now are the consequences of this subterranean carnage for surface-dwelling critters. But that has just been corrected by Malte Jochum of Leipzig University, in Germany, and his colleagues, in a study just published in .Dr Jochum and his team worked in a forest overlooking Barrier Lake, in Alberta, Canada, where the earthworm invasion has been tracked for three decades. That has permitted the identification of areas with low (four worms per square metre, on average), medium (43 worms per square metre) and high (106 per square metre) populations.Within each zone of abundance the researchers marked 20 plots with individual areas of two square metres. They identified all of the plants therein and used vacuum-suction collecting devices to \u201choover\u201d up as many as possible of the above-surface arthropods (mostly insects and spiders) in each plot. They then sorted, identified and measured these animals to calculate their abundance, biomass and species richness.Altogether, the collectors picked up 13,037 individual arthropods\u2014and discrepancies between plots were quickly obvious. Those with abundant earthworms were depauperised of arthropods compared with ones where worms were rare. Plots with the most worms in them had 61% fewer individual arthropods, 18% fewer arthropod species and a 27% diminution in total arthropod biomass, compared with those with the fewest.So-called detritivores\u2014which compete directly with worms for food\u2014suffered worst. There were 80% less of them in areas of worm abundance, compared with those of worm scarcity. But herbivores and omnivores suffered, too. Only for carnivorous arthropods, such as spiders, was there good news. Their numbers were up 41% in worm-rich plots, compared with worm-poor ones.Why predators did well is unclear. Some, perhaps, were eating worms directly. Others may have taken advantage of the stripping of cover for their prey caused by worms pulling the leaf-litter underground for later consumption.The knock-on effects of this carnage further up the food chain, among invertebrate-eating amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, remain obscure. Species that like to consume worms are presumably doing better, while those that prefer their meals crunchy, rather than squishy, will be doing worse. Whether this matters in the grand scheme of things is debatable. But for those who prefer their ecosystems pristine, this work confirms that earthworms are certainly not the unalloyed good which some people make them out to be.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/invasion-of-the-earthworms/21808464", "date_modified": "2022-03-31T14:05:50Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/03/articles/main/20220402_stp001.jpg"},

Yet given their country\u2019s vaulting ambitions, for the Chinese, at least, such neuroses are trivial, he insisted. After all, \u201cthe eagle does not concern itself with the impressions of the worm.\u201dMr Wang is one of Britain\u2019s sharpest and most surprising stand-up comedians, widely known for his observations on race and the legacy of colonialism. The set he performed at the Palladium and elsewhere on his recent tour, called \u201cPhilly Philly Wang Wang\u201d, was released on Netflix last year; he embarks on his first American tour, with fresh material, this month. His new memoir, \u201cSidesplitter: How To Be From Two Worlds At Once\u201d, includes incisive essays on language, cultural assimilation and dating. Meanwhile \u201cBudPod\u201d, a podcast co-hosted with Pierre Novellie, a fellow comedian, has exceeded 2m downloads since its debut in 2019.His life and career are an accident of history, both grand and intimate. Britain controlled parts of the Malay peninsula between the 18th and mid-20th centuries; it was exerting a softer kind of power by the time Mr Wang\u2019s mother, an anthropologist, joined the Voluntary Service Overseas. She was posted to northern Borneo where she met Mr Wang\u2019s father, a martial-arts teacher. The comedian was born in 1990 in Stoke-on-Trent in central England, but his family returned to Malaysia soon afterwards. In his book he interweaves their story with that of Kota Kinabalu, the city in which he grew up, and his attitude towards his own identity. \u201cFor an enterprise so heavily associated with death,\u201d he writes, \u201cI ironically owe the British Empire my life.\u201dHe acknowledges a debt to British comedy, too. From a young age he watched shows like \u201cBlackadder\u201d and \u201cFrench and Saunders\u201d (while admiring Harith Iskander, the \u201cgodfather of stand-up comedy in Malaysia\u201d). Comedy was a safe haven during tough years at a Chinese school, where there was a \u201cconstant threat of physical pain\u201d from corporal punishment. This period shaped his career in another way. \u201cI became really introverted and quite afraid of speaking out,\u201d he says, leaning back and closing his eyes, as if recoiling from the memory. \u201cThen finding stand-up, it was this form of communication that I thought I could do. I felt I could earn the right to speak by writing something funny.\u201dMoving back to Britain in his teens, Mr Wang took part in his first comedy night at school. Most of the material was borrowed: \u201cI didn\u2019t realise at the time you had to write your own jokes.\u201d He went on to Cambridge University, which had a thriving comedy scene, and became president of the Footlights, an incubator of entertainment greats including Eric Idle and Hugh Laurie. In 2010 he won the prestigious Chortle Student Comedy Awards. Steve Bennett, editor of Chortle, a comedy website, recalls his cool delivery, self-deprecating jokes and \u201cintricate, detached wordplay\u201d.That accolade helped Mr Wang make comedy a full-time job. He has since appeared on assorted television and radio programmes and, alongside his stand-up gigs, performed with a sketch group called Daphne. He has encountered bigots as well as fans. In one painful passage in \u201cSide splitter\u201d, he describes how a woman in the audience once loudly announced that he was unattractive because of his ethnicity. The incident confirmed his comic vocation, he says, making him even surer \u201cthat British society would benefit from an outspoken East Asian making jokes about himself from a place of authority\u201d.Mr Novellie, his collaborator on \u201cBudPod\u201d, likens Mr Wang\u2019s ability to take on subjects such as race to that of American counterparts such as Dave Chapelle. As well as their joint interest in history, films, games and scatological mishaps, Mr Novellie\u2014who was born in South Africa and brought up on the Isle of Man\u2014suggests he and Mr Wang share an \u201coutside perspective\u201d. That means that when they discuss subjects like the Elgin Marbles, ancient Greek sculptures currently held in the British Museum, they are not constrained by the sense of national embarrassment that many of their liberal peers exude.For his part, Mr Wang denies that comedy has a political duty. He says he mostly strives to entertain, encourage listeners to take themselves less seriously and point out jarring truths\u2014such as, in his bit about impressions, Chinese people being considered a \u201cvery vulnerable minority\u201d in Britain while also being linked to a \u201cglobally very powerful\u201d country. Yet, intentionally or otherwise, he is a subtle champion of nuance and balance.He uses the set-ups of jokes, and the sudden switch of a punchline, to undermine preconceptions about people and places. Perhaps, he says, the gags would come easier if he were more polemical. \u201cIt\u2019s much more funny to have a really strong opinion about something and scream about it, than it is to say: \u2018But let\u2019s look at this from the other perspective\u2019,\u201d he concedes. \u201cBut I don\u2019t.

Every few months or so Democratic lawmakers unveil plans for doing just that, only to stumble well before enacting them. It is not just that the wealthy can afford powerful lobbyists. The nature of their fortunes also makes them an elusive target for tax authorities. A new proposal by the Biden administration may offer a partial solution, provided it can overcome political and legal hurdles.The idea, contained in President Joe Biden\u2019s new budget proposal on March 28th, is that Americans worth more than $100m would pay a minimum tax of 20% on all their income, including, controversially, the appreciation of their investments. If an ultra-rich American makes a paper gain of, say, $10m on his stock portfolio in a year, he would face a liability of $2m.The goal is to close a gaping loophole. Wealthy Americans must pay capital-gains taxes of at least 20% when they sell assets. But when assets are inherited, the price at the time of the transfer forms the new basis for calculating capital gains. In this way the ultra-rich can shrink their tax bills: they owe nothing on unsold assets while alive and their heirs then benefit from the \u201cstepped-up basis\u201d for capital gains. Economists in the Biden administration have calculated that the 400 wealthiest American families pay an average federal income-tax rate of just 8%, far below the rates paid by most in the middle class.A simple way to close this loophole would be to recognise all capital gains upon inheritance. Indeed that was Mr Biden\u2019s preference in legislation last year. But opponents tarred it as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d that would bankrupt family farms. Although that charge was unfair\u2014almost all farms would have been below the tax threshold\u2014the Democrats dropped the idea.The Biden administration dubs the new proposal a \u201cbillionaire minimum income tax\u201d. Steve Rosenthal of the Tax Policy Centre, a think-tank, calls this an ingenious rebranding of the stepped-up basis idea. \u201cIt would operate like a pre-payment,\u201d he says. Taxes owed at death would be reduced by those paid previously.The White House reckons the new tax would bring in $360bn over the next decade, impressive for a levy that hits the wealthiest 0.01% of households. That, however, reflects a windfall for the state when it collects on decades of gains for the likes of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. To pay the tax, they may need to sell down stakes in their firms, potentially remaking their ownership structures. The government would cushion the blow by breaking payments into instalments (spread over nine years at first and, later, five years). Once established, the revenues would be slimmer. \u201cThe $360bn estimate makes it look more promising than it really is in the long run,\u201d says Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank.There are two immediate obstacles. As with every idea from the Biden White House, the political question is whether Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, two moderate Democratic senators, support it. They have, for different reasons, opposed previous tax increases. Then there are the courts. The constitution limits the federal government to taxing incomes, not wealth. The White House would argue that accrued capital gains are a form of income, but its proposal would face legal challenges.Even if Mr Biden were to succeed in shepherding the tax into law, another concern would emerge. The levy would be complex, especially for assets that do not trade in public markets. Lawyers would devise new structures to shelter wealth. \u201cTheir pencils are being sharpened even as we speak,\u201d says Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan.

Already, China has started training the local force in riot control and handling replica weapons, after years when Australia and New Zealand have taken primary responsibility for dealing with unrest in the Solomon Islands and for reforming the police force.The Solomons switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 2019. Since then China has begun repairing the country\u2019s only gold mine and taken over Taiwan\u2019s financing of controversial \u201cconstituency development funds\u201d for s, and the state-owned China Civil Engineering Corporation has started building a stadium for the South Pacific Games next year. China\u2019s Pacific expansion does not offer commercial rewards as big as those available in Africa or South-East Asia, but it does bring important prizes in its long war of diplomatic attrition with Taiwan. Kiribati, too, switched recognition to China in 2019, leaving only four Pacific countries still aligned with Taiwan (Nauru, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Palau).But China\u2019s enhanced presence has met stiff resistance from the provincial government on Malaita, the Solomons\u2019 most populous island, whose provincial premier, Daniel Suidani, is the most vociferous opponent of Chinese influence. Mr Sogavare has tried in vain to dislodge him. To back Mr Suidani, many Malaitans in November descended on the capital, Honiara, demanding that the prime minister himself step down. The protests triggered serious rioting, and the destruction of most of the Chinatown business district. Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji deployed peacekeepers. Mr Sogavare now says he wants to diversify his security partners by seeking assistance also from China. He denies Australian media reports of a planned Chinese military base.Mr Sogavare, who has had four stints as prime minister (all of which have ended prematurely), has long had frosty relations with Australia. His second term followed serious rioting in April 2006, during the 14-year-long Australia-led Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (), which also involved New Zealand. He did his utmost to undermine  He expelled both an Australian high commissioner and an Australian police chief, but was himself then ousted in a no-confidence vote in December 2007.His downfall then was partly a consequence of his poor relations with regional allies. This time, however, Mr Sogavare survived a no-confidence vote only in December, allegedly thanks to Chinese money disbursed as largesse to pro-government s. Another election looms in 2023, but Mr Sogavare wants to extend the parliamentary term to give himself an extra year. That suggestion has proved hugely unpopular with Solomon Islanders.Australia and New Zealand can do little to meddle directly in the Solomons\u2019 domestic affairs, but both wield considerable influence. Covid-19 struck at last in January, wreaking havoc, particularly in Honiara, increasing the country\u2019s dependence on traditional aid partners to prop up the city\u2019s dilapidated \u201cNumber 9\u201d hospital. And many Solomon Islanders are horrified by pictures in the local press of baton-wielding Chinese riot police honing their skills in quelling protests.The new security arrangement with China bears some resemblance to the ones with Australia and New Zealand covering police assistance. A big difference stems from Chinese settlers\u2019 big presence in Honiara. They own many of the city\u2019s small retail outlets, benefit from shady deals with the cash-strapped ethnic-Melanesian government and were the main targets of rioters in both 2006 and 2021. The main job for the next generation of would-be peacekeepers may be protecting Chinese settlers\u2014or even exercising their policing talents on some of those rugged migrants on the Pacific frontier.

The idea was to send Russia\u2019s economy into free fall, punishing President Vladimir Putin for his aggression. In the week after the invasion the rouble fell by more than a third against the dollar, and the share prices of many Russian companies collapsed.Is the West\u2019s strategy still going to plan? The chaos in Russian markets seems to have subsided. Since its low in early March the rouble has jumped, and is now approaching its pre-war level. The main benchmark of Russian stocks plunged by a third, but has since stabilised. The government and most firms are keeping up with their payments on foreign-currency bonds. A run on banks that saw nearly 3trn roubles ($31bn) withdrawn came to an end, with Russians returning much of the cash to their accounts.A battery of policies has helped stabilise the markets. Some are orthodox. The central bank has raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20%, encouraging people to hold interest-bearing Russian assets. Other policies are less conventional. The government has decreed that exporters must convert 80% of their foreign-exchange proceeds into roubles. Trading on the Moscow stock exchange has become, to use the central bank\u2019s euphemism, \u201cnegotiated\u201d. Short-selling is banned, and non-residents cannot offload stocks until April 1st.The real economy, though, is in some ways the mirror image of the financial one: healthier than it seems at first glance. A weekly measure of consumer prices shows that they have risen by more than 5% since the beginning of March alone. Many foreign firms have pulled out, cutting the supply of goods, while a weaker currency and sanctions have made imports more expensive. But not everything is surging in price. Vodka, largely produced domestically, costs only a bit more than it did before the war. Petrol costs about the same. And though it is early days, there is little evidence yet of a big hit to economic activity.According to an estimate based on internet-search data and produced by the , a rich-country think-tank, Russia\u2019s  in the week to March 26th was about 5% higher than the year before. Other \u201creal-time\u201d data gathered by , such as electricity consumption and railway loadings of goods, are holding up. A spending tracker produced by Sberbank, Russia\u2019s largest lender, is slightly up year on year. Part of this reflects people stockpiling goods before prices rise: spending on home appliances is especially strong. But spending on services has fallen only a bit, and remains far healthier than it was during much of the pandemic.Russia seems sure to enter a recession this year. But whether it ends up faring as badly as most economists predict\u2014the wonks are pencilling in a  decline of 10-15%\u2014depends on three factors. The first is whether ordinary Russians start worrying about the economy as the war drags on, and reduce spending\u2014as happened in 2014, when Russia invaded Crimea. The second is whether production eventually grinds to a halt as sanctions block firms\u2019 access to imports from the West. Russia\u2019s aviation sector looks particularly vulnerable, as does the car industry. Yet many big businesses that started during Soviet times are used to operating without imports. If any economy could come close to coping with being cut off from the world, it would be Russia\u2019s.The third and most important factor relates to Russia\u2019s fossil-fuel exports. Despite the many sanctions imposed on it, Russia is still selling about $10bn-worth of oil a month to foreign buyers, equivalent to a quarter of its pre-war exports; revenues from the sale of natural gas and other petroleum products are still flowing in, too. This provides a valuable source of foreign currency with which it can buy some consumer goods and parts from neutral or friendly countries. Unless that changes, the Russian economy may continue to defy the worst predictions.

The government, as well as industrial lobby groups and think-tanks close either to it or to trade unions, argue that a ban would lead to high unemployment, mass poverty and a recession. But some independent economists, as well as a number of opposition politicians, insist that the consequences would be manageable, if substantial.The debate may yet become moot. On March 30th Robert Habeck, Germany\u2019s minister for economy and climate, activated the first stage of an emergency plan to manage gas supplies in case Russia turns off the tap. Russia is threatening to do so because Germany and the rest of the 7 are refusing to accept its demand that \u201cunfriendly\u201d countries pay for gas in roubles rather than euros or dollars, which sanctions have made it hard for Russia to use.But if the gas keeps flowing, so will the debate about the morality of buying it. Germany has been importing around \u20ac1.8bn ($2bn)-worth of Russian gas, oil and coal a month, thereby helping to finance Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Mr Scholz says stopping that would hurt Germany more than Russia, even though other European governments have called for an embargo. This week the , a think-tank close to Germany\u2019s trade unions, published a study that backs the government\u2019s gloomy assessment. It says halting energy imports from Russia would cause a deep recession, with  shrinking by more than 6% even if alternative suppliers could make up for half of the gas supplied by Russia. These are rough estimates. \u201cIt is impossible to model a stop of gas imports seriously,\u201d cautions Sebastian Dullien of the .The  finds itself in rare agreement with industrial lobbies such as the , the association of German industry. In early March, Siegfried Russwurm, the \u2019s boss, warned that talk about an  embargo on Russian energy is \u201cplaying with fire\u201d and would harm the  more than the aggressor. , a German chemicals giant, said that if its gas supply is halved it will need to halt production at the world\u2019s biggest chemicals plant in Ludwigshafen, which employs around 40,000 people. Hundreds of thousands of related jobs would be in danger. Martin Bruderm\u00fcller, the boss of , told investors on March 26th, \u201cThere is no way Russian gas can be replaced in the short term.\u201dThese pessimistic assessments are contradicted by the German Institute for Economic Research (); a working paper co-written by a group of German and international economists and published by , another research outfit; and tribute, an economics research group involving the universities of Bonn and Cologne. These suggest that German  would take a hit of up to 3% if imports of Russian energy were to cease immediately. That is substantially less than the 4.5% decline of German  in 2020, the first year of the covid-19 pandemic, which Germany stoically managed to weather.\u201cThe big problem is gas,\u201d says Moritz Schularick, one of the authors of the paper. The loss of Russian oil and coal could be managed relatively easily, since they can be replaced by imports from other countries. But Germany gets roughly half its gas from Russia. An increase in gas imports from other countries, the substitution of electricity from coal or nuclear power for the gas-fired sort and a steady refilling of storage facilities over the summer could only make up for 70% of that, he reckons.The central question is how German industry would cope. Everyone agrees that finding quick substitutes for gas in industrial processes is a daunting task. Yet Benjamin Moll, one of the other authors of the paper, notes that during the second world war the American economy showed an astonishing ability to adapt to similar shortages. When in 1940 America\u2019s president, Franklin Roosevelt, demanded that American firms produce 50,000 fighter planes a year, economists deemed his request insane, because yearly aircraft production for the military in 1939 was fewer than 3,000. By the end of the war America had produced 300,000 fighters.In an interview with  a weekly newspaper, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a former finance minister, argues that people sometimes have to make substantial sacrifices for their way of life and their freedoms. Moreover, prolonging the war in Ukraine is also costly for European economies. \u201cThere are lots of hidden costs because of the uncertainty,\u201d says Luis Garicano, a Spanish member of the European Parliament, who backs an immediate  energy embargo. Mr Garicano fears that such an embargo will only happen after Russia further escalates its brutal war. \u201cWe should not wait for that,\u201d he says.

The children were told to keep silent, recalls Tsunoka Yasuji, who was eight years old in 1945 when his family fled Habomai, one of four Japanese islands just north of Hokkaido that defeated imperial Japan lost to Russia in the final days of the second world war. The islands, which Japan calls the Northern Territories and Russia the Southern Kuriles, have remained contentious ever since, preventing the two neighbours from concluding a formal peace treaty.The arrival of Russian soldiers in Ukraine has conjured up painful memories for former residents. It has also precipitated a dramatic shift in Japan\u2019s policy towards Russia. The Japanese government long sought to maintain friendlier relations than its Western partners, in part to ease negotiations for the return of the islands. Japan refrained from imposing harsh sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014. Abe Shinzo, Japan\u2019s longest-serving prime minister, met Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, 27 times between 2012 and 2020.Under Kishida Fumio, the current prime minister, Japan is firmly behind Ukraine and beside the West. Breaking with pacifist precedent, it sent bulletproof vests to Ukraine\u2019s army. It also cracked open its doors to people fleeing Ukraine, a contrast with its usual reluctance to take refugees. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, addressed the Diet (by video link), an honour never afforded Mr Putin. Japan has also adopted the full slate of Western sanctions, despite long-standing scepticism about their use in general.One motivation for the change is domestic. The Japanese public overwhelmingly supports tough measures against Russia. Another is geopolitical. If Japan opted out of the Western coalition this time, it would be harder to call for solidarity in an Asian security crisis. Japanese officials may also calculate that a second aim of engaging Russia\u2014driving a wedge between it and China\u2014will be near impossible as Russian dependence on China increases after the war.Yet solidarity with the West against Russia creates new challenges for Japan. Around 8% of Japan\u2019s natural gas comes from Russia\u2014less than Europe imports, but enough to matter. Japan has resisted calls to pull out of its energy projects on Russia\u2019s Sakhalin island. Japanese firms have reported an increase in cyber-attacks since the start of the invasion.Russia does not directly threaten Hokkaido, but it can still make trouble, especially in concert with China and North Korea. On March 25th some 3,000 of its troops held drills on the disputed islands. Russian ships have been unusually active near Japan in recent weeks. Russia called off the peace-treaty negotiations and cancelled visa-free travel for former residents of the islands. On Hokkaido\u2019s northern coast, locals fret about tensions over fishing rights and rising prices for sea urchin and crab imported from Russia. The situation will get \u201cincredibly dire\u201d, warns Odajima Hideo of Hoppoukan, a museum in northern Hokkaido dedicated to the Northern Territories, noting that thousands of Japanese fishing boats and sailors were taken prisoner during the cold war.Since the cold war ended, Japan, more than most countries, has enjoyed what Japanese call , or the blur of peace. China\u2019s rise had begun to sharpen the vision. For some, Russia\u2019s invasion has been like putting on glasses. Hasegawa Michiko, whose family owns a bakery just off the coast in Shibetsu, from where the Russian-controlled islands are visible, says it has \u201cflipped my worldview\u201d. Calls for increased defence spending are louder. So is talk of controversial new capabilities, including the possession of missiles to strike enemy bases or the hosting of American nuclear weapons.The invasion of Ukraine has another, more hopeful echo in Japan: the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05. Russia entered that contest too confident in its army and too dismissive of its foe. As a result, it suffered a humiliating defeat that helped fuel the revolution of 1905 and weakened the monarchy. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful about the islands: maybe Putin will fall,\u201d offers Sasaki Masashi, who oversees a small information centre for Russian sailors on Hokkaido\u2019s north-eastern coast, where Ukrainian embroidery is now displayed alongside a Russian  doll.

Fans have spent the past month mourning his death. But on March 28th the Chinese foreign ministry suggested Mr Norbu might still be alive. In response to questions about him, the ministry said a man in Tibet had \u201cattempted suicide by self-immolation\u201d\u2014and that he had been taken for treatment immediately. The man had long been \u201ctroubled by mental illness\u201d and \u201chad attempted suicide multiple times\u201d, claimed the authorities. Activists are unconvinced.Fans were shocked by Mr Norbu\u2019s action. Over the past decade, scores of Tibetans have burnt themselves to death in protest at Chinese rule. But Mr Norbu did not appear to be a dissident. The 25-year-old had competed on a popular reality show, \u201cSing! China\u201d, only months earlier. The judges called him  (radish), a Mandarin homophone for Norbu. In videos he would rap about love. Sometimes he would play piano or guitar as he sang tunes by Camila Cabello and Frankie Valli. With his pierced ears and groomed eyebrows, he could have been a Gen Z-er from anywhere.But Mr Norbu was from Tibet. That meant he lived in two worlds. There was the Tibet promoted by the Chinese authorities: a glossy, exotic \u201cminority region\u201d, where grateful nomads and monks were being lifted out of poverty. Then there was the Tibet experienced by locals, who have watched the authorities tear down Buddhist statues, close Tibetan-language schools and arrest anyone who resisted the state\u2019s campaign of sinicisation. Those who only saw the first world could not comprehend why one of its stars would set himself on fire. Those who knew the second immediately understood.When Mr Norbu spoke of Tibet he was careful. He would mention his father, a composer in a state-run song-and-dance troupe whose songs honoured Tibetan culture. Mr Norbu did not speak of the deadly crackdown after protests in Nagchu, where he grew up, in 2013. He certainly did not mention his uncle, Lodoe Gyatso, who served a prison term for murder (his supporters say it was self-defence) and is now in jail for protesting against Chinese rule.Mr Norbu may not have been outwardly political, but he clearly took pride in Tibet. He avoided the \u201cred songs\u201d performed by his mother, a singer in a troupe run by the Chinese army. Those ditties featured lyrics thanking the \u201clife-saving\u201d Communist Party. Instead Mr Norbu wrote songs like \u201cTsampa\u201d, an ode to the Tibetan staple food made of roasted barley flour. A video for the song features the singer dancing around Lhasa. At one point he bows, placing a hand on his heart, as two monks pass.These were signs of Mr Norbu\u2019s true feelings\u2014his reverence for Tibetan identity\u2014say activists. They point to his rendition of \u201cReturn to the Homeland\u201d on \u201cSing! China\u201d. He wore a traditional  robe and delivered the first lines in a Tibetan folk-style vibrato: \u201cThere is a land known as the homeland, there is a happiness known as the home.\u201d He even changed the lyrics, referring to Tibet instead of Nagchu in the lilting last verse. Secretly, he was singing for the nation, claim Tibetans.Whereas his songs contained subtle clues about his politics, his self-immolation made them clear. Mr Norbu chose the most sensitive location in Lhasa: the Potala Palace, the traditional residence of the Dalai Lama. And he picked a sensitive time, days before the meeting of China\u2019s parliament in Beijing. To pull off such an act shows not desperation, but the \u201cutmost determination\u201d, says Matthew Akester, a Tibet researcher based in India.In some ways Mr Norbu seemed like the Chinese government\u2019s ideal minority youth: urban, educated and fluent in Mandarin. On China\u2019s National Day last year, he posted a video of himself bringing his fingers together. \u201cI make a heart for the motherland,\u201d read the accompanying hashtag. But Tibetans saw through that, says Tsering Woeser, a Tibetan writer and activist (who lives under surveillance). \u201cChinese people only saw the image. They only saw the surface,\u201d says Ms Woeser. \u201cWe know Tsewang\u2019s real struggles.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2022/04/02/deciphering-a-tibetan-pop-stars-self-immolation", "date_modified": "2022-03-31T11:37:01Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220402_CNP002_0.jpg"},

One lyric hints that residents can grow vegetables in the small patches of land outside their apartments or scavenge for edible plants.The song attracted hundreds of thousands of views online in less than a day, bringing cheer to an otherwise grim situation. China is currently facing its worst outbreak since the pandemic started in the city of Wuhan in 2020. Thousands of new cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant are being discovered each day. The large cities of Shenzhen and Shenyang, as well as the entire province of Jilin, have been locked down in recent weeks.Now it is Shanghai\u2019s turn. The two-phase lockdown of the city, whose 25m inhabitants have been mostly spared harsh containment efforts in the past two years, was announced hours before it began at 5am. The local government had gone to great lengths to avoid shutting down the metropolis, especially its wealthy central districts. In coming weeks it will find it difficult to project an image of business as usual\u2014because business is anything but.The lockdown\u2019s first phase covers areas east of Huangpu river, home to the main financial centre. Many white-collar workers have packed up toiletry bags and moved into their offices until April 1st, when the lockdown is supposed to be lifted in the east and imposed instead in western neighbourhoods. In order to keep the stock exchange running, employees are said to be sleeping on the floor of the bourse. Countless companies listed in Shanghai have put out statements in recent days to notify investors that they are shutting down their factories in the region and, in some cases, elsewhere in the country. Tesla is suspending production at its electric-car factory in the city, according to Reuters.The pain will be felt abroad, too, just as it was amid the lockdowns in Shenzhen, another city deeply entangled in global supply chains. Although seaborne traffic can be diverted from Shanghai to other ports, such as Ningbo around 100km to the south, the cross-border flow of people is being disrupted. International flights have been rerouted to airports in other cities. Shanghai\u2019s tourism businesses are bracing for a year that will even worse than 2020.The measures may stretch beyond eight days; parts of the city could remain closed once more cases are identified, as is likely given Omicron\u2019s transmissibility. One team of economists estimates that a one-month lockdown of Shanghai and its spillover effects would knock a staggering 4% off China\u2019s  in that period. Whatever the eventual cost, in the short run the Shanghai experiment is the biggest test yet of China\u2019s \u201czero-covid\u201d approach to snuffing out the virus. Officials hope that \u201cproduction bubbles\u201d, instituted in Shenzhen and other places to bus workers to and from factories in a covid-controlled manner, will work in Shanghai, too. If they do, China may be able to cling to its draconian strategy for longer. If they fail\u2014as they might in the face of Omicron\u2014the authorities will be under pressure to relent.

For proof consider his speech in Warsaw on March 26th. Vladimir Putin\u2019s carnage in Ukraine was part of a global \u201cbattle between democracy and autocracy\u201d, he declared, closing with an impromptu line: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d Was Mr Biden advocating regime change in Russia?

Vladimir Putin\u2019s carnage in Ukraine was part of a global \u201cbattle between democracy and autocracy\u201d, he declared, closing with an impromptu line: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, this man cannot remain in power.\u201d Was Mr Biden advocating regime change in Russia? No, his aides hastened to say, soon followed by the president himself.The political gaffe, the commentator Michael Kinsley memorably observed, is when a politician inadvertently speaks the truth. Mr Biden\u2019s many slips often involve him getting muddled or, as in 2012, being unable to catch a . Seeking to cast Barack Obama as a hard man of world affairs, the then vice-president cited Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick. \u201cI promise you, the president has a big stick.\u201dMr Biden\u2019s words in Warsaw were different, deliberate and in keeping with insults\u2014\u201cwar criminal\u201d, \u201cbutcher\u201d\u2014he has been hurling at Russia\u2019s leader. Critics charge that, in suggesting he seeks Mr Putin\u2019s downfall, Mr Biden will harden Russia\u2019s resolve on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. This misses the mark. The reproach rings especially hollow coming from Republicans who still bow to the dangerously wayward and Putin-loving Donald Trump. (On March 29th he urged Mr Putin to reveal dirt on the Biden family.) There is little doubt the world would be better without Mr Putin; and he already thinks America is out to get him.Rather, Mr Biden\u2019s failing in Warsaw is what might be called the Reverse Roosevelt Doctrine: speak loudly and carry a small stick. To Poles and Ukrainians in the audience, Mr Biden\u2019s most fervent lines carried disturbing implications. Telling Mr Putin \u201cdon\u2019t even think about moving on one single inch of  territory\u201d sounds like giving him carte blanche to do his worst in Ukrainian territory. \u201cWe need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead\u201d implies that he will do nothing to stop horrors quickly.The parallels he drew\u2014the Hungarian uprising of 1956, the Prague spring of 1968 and Solidarity\u2019s strikes in Poland in 1980\u2014all referred to events behind the iron curtain, where America had little influence. Mr Biden did not mention, say, Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 or Serbian atrocities in Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s, which America halted through military action. Intervention in Ukraine, Mr Biden says, would risk \u201cWorld War III\u201d.Finding a course between preventing Russia\u2019s takeover of Ukraine and averting nuclear escalation involves much semantic and legal contortion. What weaponry is defensive, or what action escalatory? Mr Biden sends Ukraine anti-tank weapons, but not tanks; anti-aircraft missiles but not military aircraft. He is at pains to say what he will not do: no to American troops on the ground, no to no-fly zones. His response to Mr Putin\u2019s madman nuclear threats is reassurance that America will not get involved. Mr Biden invoked the words of the late Polish pope, John Paul II, \u201cBe not afraid.\u201d Yet it is the president who seems frightened of tangling with Mr Putin, not the other way around.How to explain this caution? The first and most obvious reason is that Russia has a bigger stockpile of nuclear weapons than America does, and a greater doctrinal propensity to use them. Even Mr Biden\u2019s fiercest critics agree that getting into a war with Russia would be a bad idea. The second factor is Mr Biden\u2019s aversion to America\u2019s over-reliance on force, given the quagmires in Iraq and Afghanistan. Military action should be a last resort, not the first, he thinks; and should be used only when vital interests are at stake. His economic sanctions on Russia, he believes, are \u201ca new kind of economic statecraft with the power to inflict damage that rivals military might\u201d.Left unsaid is that Ukraine is probably not as important to Mr Biden as, say, Taiwan. America sees Russia as a disrupter, and China as the only challenger to its supremacy. Another of Mr Biden\u2019s gaffes last year is telling. Asked whether America would defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack, he replied: \u201cYes, we have a commitment to do that.\u201d The White House rushed to clarify that the president intended no change in America\u2019s \u201cone-China\u201d policy, or its doctrine of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d about defending the island. For Taiwan, then, Mr Biden does seem ready to risk nuclear war.A cynical possibility, which many Ukrainians believe, is that Mr Biden wants a drawn-out war to exhaust Russia, at the cost of much Ukrainian blood. That may be too Machiavellian. There is little sign that the Biden administration has thought much about the end-game. It says it will not dictate the terms that Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, should accept. This is disingenuous given that Mr Biden in effect sets limits on what Ukraine can achieve. If Mr Zelensky does not have the weapons with which to evict Russian forces, he will have to give up territory; if  will not admit Ukraine, he will have to accept neutrality.Now that Russia is bleeding in the battlefield, prominent Americans want Mr Biden to go all-out to help Mr Zelensky rout the Russian army. Victory would revitalise democracy and might even bring down Mr Putin. Mr Biden, however, prefers the long game. Ukraine is bravely holding its ground, Russia is being weakened and China is paying a political cost for embracing Mr Putin. Only Russia\u2019s leader knows what would make him resort to nuclear weapons, but a senior American defence official thinks the triggers probably include \u201cthe prospect of all-out conventional defeat of Russia\u2019s military\u201d or a threat to the Russian state (in other words, a threat to Mr Putin).What about Mr Biden\u2019s chin-jutting in Warsaw? It is probably moral outrage, as he says, with perhaps some cheap rhetoric. The president may be loose in his tough talk, and cautious to a fault in his actions. But in the nuclear age that is surely better than emulating a swashbuckling militarist like Teddy Roosevelt.

Maud Newton is one of them\u2014but as well as spitting into a tube she spent years digging into her ancestry, researching not just her lineage but everything from the science of genetics to traditional \u201cancestor veneration\u201d. This \u201cancestor obsession\u201d, she writes in her first book, sprang from worry about what she might have inherited from her troubled family.Unpalatable behaviour among her relations includes homicide by hay hook, Bible-thumping mania, mental illness and a grandfather who was married ten times. Ms Newton\u2019s own conception was \u201ca home-grown eugenics project\u201d, she reports. Her parents \u201cmarried not for love but because they believed they would have smart children together\u201d. If, as Tolstoy famously remarked, every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, Ms Newton\u2019s clan is a knockout.Such wild material can make for compelling memoir. Yet Ms Newton has broader ambitions. Her book is stuffed with detailed forays into biology, anthropology and intergenerational trauma, as well as ancient and modern stories. No stone is left unturned as she seeks to discover what her nutty ancestors might have handed down. Readers new to genealogy will find it a useful introduction; to others it may feel like an overfull carpet-bag.Still, her desire to know where she comes from is widely shared. The preoccupation with \u201croots\u201d has been burgeoning in America since 1977, when Alex Haley\u2019s television programme of that name was first broadcast. People whose presence on the continent is due to colonisation, enslavement and migration tend to be hazier on their ancestry than citizens of longer settled countries. For many Americans, the internet changed that. Millions of people now pore over family trees; ancestral sleuthing is big business, including the use of  databases to identify criminals.Much of this was made possible by the Mormons. Among the fascinating titbits Ms Newton relates is the fact that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints \u201crequires members to routinely produce names of dead relatives for posthumous baptism\u201d. Thus was born the vast genealogical database that it keeps in a vault in a Utah mountain. Such registries, though popular, are imprecise, and can suck in people who never asked to be included. In particular,  databases lend themselves to abuses such as racial profiling (as in the creation of facial \u201cmugshots\u201d that are extrapolated from  evidence).For all that research, though, \u201cthe nature-nurture puzzle of personality\u201d remains unsolved. Epigenetics, the study of the interplay between genes and their expression, is still in its infancy, Ms Newton notes. At bottom, this is what she most wants to understand. Are her bouts of depression, irrationality and self-harm\u2014and her creativity\u2014in some sense inherited? Psychotherapy seems not to have supplied an answer. Ultimately she finds relief in connecting with those troublesome predecessors through an alternative approach called \u201cancestral lineage healing\u201d.Her most compelling chapters detail a whole set of \u201cmonstrous bequests\u201d handed down to this white daughter of the American South. On one side, an ancestor robbed and probably murdered Native Americans. On the other, successive generations of plantation owners in the Mississippi Delta enslaved scores of African-Americans. Her estranged father\u2019s grandparents were \u201copenly, unremittingly\u2014\u2018jubilantly\u2019 would not be too strong a word\u2014racist.\u201dIt is a toxic inheritance, to which Ms Newton returns again and again, asking whether and how descendants today can atone for their ancestors\u2019 sins. At a moment of reckoning over America\u2019s violent history, her book is a salutary call for an \u201cacknowledgment genealogy\u201d of the harms that are hidden in many family trees.

Over the past two years she has made a regular trip on public transport across three boroughs of New York City, requiring two changes and one hour in either direction, to reach The HopeLine, a food bank in the Bronx. Waiting in the cold outside it one morning, she says the food and nappies (a rare offering) are worth it: \u201cOnly my husband is working. I have to take care of my two babies, so this helps a lot.\u201dRather than being supplements to the safety net, food banks such as The HopeLine have become something like stopgaps. The world\u2019s richest country has done an especially poor job at looking after its youngest. Among industrialised countries, America has consistently ranked among the worst for its child-poverty rate. The reason for this is no real mystery: the welfare state does not redistribute much to the poorest families. Many of the countries with far lower rates of child poverty, such as Canada, Hungary and Poland, have achieved their success by creating child allowances\u2014regular payments to parents of modest amounts of cash.So there were grounds for optimism when America began an experiment\u2014little noticed but grand in scope\u2014with a child allowance. Created by the American Rescue Plan, the gargantuan stimulus bill that President Joe Biden signed in March 2021, the scheme began making monthly payments in July to the families of 60m children (most of the 73m in the country). These amounted to $300 a month for each young child and $250 for older ones.For Ms Maharjan, who kept making her long trips to the Bronx, the monthly cash was enough to go from scraping by to begin \u201cinvesting\u201d in her children. \u201cThat helps a lot, especially for minimum-income people like me,\u201d she says. She looks crestfallen as she remembers that the payments stopped in December\u2014after Democrats, by failing to agree on much of the president\u2019s agenda, could not approve an extension.Those six months provided a full-scale experiment for whether European-style safety-net programmes could work in America. Sceptics doubted that the Internal Revenue Service would be able to turn itself into a quasi-welfare agency in a matter of three months. A senior White House official notes that Social Security and the Affordable Care Act required years of preparation before beginning.The early assessments were rosy. Scholars at Columbia University developed a monthly measure of child poverty that is much speedier than the official annual data. Between June 2021 and July 2021 their estimates registered a large drop in the child-poverty rate\u2014from 15.8% to 11.9%. Put another way, the number of children in poverty fell by 40%. That was the result of all covid-related relief programmes, but the monthly payments alone drove a 25% drop in poverty in their first month.As uplifting as the result may have been, the converse is as dismal. Since the payments lapsed, the researchers calculate that most of the gains made against child poverty have been reversed (see chart). In December 2021, the rate was 12.1%. \u201cBy the end of the six months, in December, we saw close to 4m children being kept out of poverty,\u201d says Megan Curran, policy director at Columbia\u2019s Centre on Poverty and Social Policy. By February 2022, it had returned to 16.7%\u2014meaning 38% more children (or 3.4m) were in poverty.Rather than revel in a rare policy victory, America has instead managed to snatch defeat from its jaws. \u201cWe have had such a high rate of poverty because we\u2019ve essentially treated America\u2019s children like they are someone else\u2019s children,\u201d says Michael Bennet, a Democratic senator from Colorado, a longtime champion of a policy derided as Utopian until the pandemic hit. (Mr Bennet\u2019s brother works for ; he was not involved in writing or editing this article.) Mr Bennet has had a bittersweet experience: watching an idea he fostered become reality, but only briefly. \u201cWe cut childhood poverty, almost in half. And then we let it lapse and doubled childhood poverty,\u201d says Mr Bennet.Most pre-existing federal support programmes for children have means tests, work requirements or conditions on the use of cash. The generous child tax benefits lacked all of these features, yet seemed especially successful at reducing poverty. That is not because the old regime of child tax credits lacked generosity (offering a maximum annual benefit of $2,000 compared with $3,600 for the enhanced credit) but because it was poorly designed as an anti-poverty tool. Low-earning families often did not have enough income to justify receiving the full credit. Absurdly, half of African-American and Hispanic children were not getting the full benefit because they were too poor.The admirably broad scope of the new policy may have limited its longevity, however. A plan to extend the benefits was one component of Mr Biden\u2019s Build Back Better agenda, which floundered in congressional negotiations in December 2021 after Senator Joe Manchin, a pivotal Democrat of West Virginia, announced his opposition.

And it was reported that government employees will be obliged to wear traditional dress and sport beards. That would be tricky for women, had they not mostly been sent home months ago.President Joe Biden\u2019s disorderly retreat from Kabul last year doomed an elected government and allowed the Taliban to seize power. That may or may not have helped convince Vladimir Putin that the West was weak and emboldened him to attack Ukraine. What is certain is that it handed Afghanistan back to a group of violent misogynists. And though the Taliban claim to have mellowed since they first ran the country in 1996-2001, many of them plainly have not. Granted, they now allow girls to attend primary school, which they banned before. But once those girls hit puberty they must put down their books and .The Taliban may have changed dispiritingly little in the past two decades; but Afghan society has changed a lot. The share of girls who attended primary school rose from zero in 2001 to 85% by 2019. For secondary school it was a less impressive 40%. A generation of Afghan women has tasted a measure of freedom. Their voices have not entirely been silenced. Street protests have erupted in Kabul against the closures of girls\u2019 schools. Activists lamenting them have appeared on local television. Some Afghan men object to the loss of their wives\u2019 income, and the hassle of having to accompany them everywhere.The government\u2019s last-minute -turn over schools suggests that even among the Taliban, there is internal disagreement. The outside world must decide how best to encourage the regime\u2019s less repressive elements. It is a tricky balancing act. Isolating Afghanistan would favour the hardliners; lifting all sanctions would reward a brutal regime. Overthrowing the Taliban militarily, as the West did in 2001 after they harboured al-Qaeda terrorists, is out of the question.Some donors hope that economic pressure might persuade them to change. Certain kinds of foreign assistance have been made conditional on girls being allowed to go to school. Amer ican officials have pulled out of talks with the Taliban in Doha, where funding for education was to be discussed. The World Bank has put $600m of development projects on hold. However, history suggests that making aid conditional on better behaviour by an unwilling regime seldom works.Meanwhile, more than half the population is suffering \u201cacute food insecurity\u201d, according to the World Food Programme. Earlier this year the  launched its largest-ever appeal for a single country, hoping to raise $4.4bn. No one is trying to make such emergency aid conditional, but nor is the world rushing to feed the 40m struggling Afghans. Only 13% of the requested sum had been committed by March 31st, when a pledging conference was to open. Some of the emergency aid will inevitably leak and prop up the Taliban, but donors should provide it anyway. Human lives are at stake.To send a signal, non-emergency assistance and diplomatic recognition should be withheld until female Afghans enjoy their basic rights. But the argument must be won within the Taliban. No society thrives by hobbling half its population. Those that oppress women are more likely to be poor, violent and unstable. Some Taliban know this and they must prevail over their reactionary brothers. Afghanistan\u2019s future rests on this frail hope.

For years afterwards the stars seemed to be losing some of their shine.Now they are back in the ascendant. Having declined as a share of  between 2017 and 2019, exports of Indian software services ticked up again as the world\u2019s companies turned to them for help amid the disruption to operations and  systems wrought by the pandemic. In the last financial year they reached an all-time high of $150bn, or 5.6% of Indian  (see chart). , a trade body, expects the industry\u2019s overall revenues to grow from $227bn last year to $350bn by 2026.In the 12 months to March sales at , Infosys and Wipro are once again forecast to grow by double digits\u2014this time from a much higher base than 20 years ago. All told, they could rake in nearly $60bn next year, up from just over $40bn in 2019 (see chart 3). In the past two years they have added an astonishing 200,000 or so people to their combined workforce, which now numbers nearly 1.1m. Add the Indian businesses of big Western -services firms such as Cognizant (which is based in New Jersey but India-focused),  and Capgemini, as well as smaller Indian rivals and around 1,600 \u201ccaptives\u201d, as in-house Indian operations of foreign firms are known, and the headcount rises to 5m.Both revenues and ranks of Indian  look poised to keep growing briskly. Lalit Ahuja, who runs a firm that helps set up captives, says a new one opens every other week. , the industry\u2019s brightest star, reckons that its sales will rise from nearly $30bn today to $50bn before 2030. The company is eyeing 1m employees. Infosys and Wipro have comparable ambitions. And investors are buying it. The stockmarket value of the big three has doubled to $330bn since covid-19 first emerged. With the addition of Cognizant and Tech Mahindra, another Indian firm, the figure is around $400bn (see chart 4). This represents a huge bet on the future of white-collar jobs.Three global forces lie behind Indian \u2019s sparkling outlook. All manner of businesses are digitising ever more of their operations. They are moving more activities to the computing cloud. And work is becoming more remote. India\u2019s low-cost, competent coders can help with all three.Start with digitisation. The pandemic has turbocharged efforts by companies of all stripes to make their businesses more agile, efficient and clever. Retailers have introduced kerbside pickup. Clinics have launched digital doctor\u2019s appointments. Schools have run online classes. Factories have been kitted out with sensors to allow remote monitoring in the absence of workers, locked down at home. Data from covid-19 vaccine trials have been crunched. All these innovations required sophisticated software. A lot if it has been developed in India since early 2020. And there is more to come. Among Infosys\u2019s projects are several connected to electric cars (including software for the vehicles themselves and for petrol stations to offer charging).The corporate great migration to the cloud offers further opportunities. According to Anuj Kadyan of McKinsey, a consultancy, big ones include supervising the migration itself for clients, ensuring that the new cloud operations are cyber-secure and adding advanced cloud-based data analytics and artificial intelligence () on top. Earlier this year JPMorgan Chase, an American bank, announced it would add 6,000 people to its substantial Indian business to work on the cloud, cyber-security and .  has opened a cyber-security centre in India to cater to its Asian clients.Combined, digitisation and the cloud make it possible for companies to untether from their physical headquarters not just peripheral functions but parts of their ever more digital core business. Many have done just that during the pandemic, thanks to remote work. This opens up the third opportunity for India\u2019s  consultants. They could assume some of the core corporate roles from white-collar workers in the rich world. Wages for new hires in India can be as little as $5,000 annually, less than a tenth of the going rate in rich countries. Even factoring in other costs, Indian projects are at least 20% cheaper than the same endeavours in the West, estimates Peter Bendor-Samuel, boss of the Everest Group, a consultancy.A ballooning Indian \u201ctalent cloud\u201d, as  calls it, is the biggest opportunity of all. It is also the most uncertain. Some Western companies are having second thoughts about hybrid work (which requires at least partial presence in the office), let alone the fully remote sort. Indian wages are also beginning to rise. India\u2019s  giants and captives are competing for the best and brightest among themselves, as well as with a vibrant startup scene. McKinsey estimates that compensation costs have risen by 20-30% over the past year. Company executives say it is not uncommon for employees to ask for their wages to be doubled. Attrition at the big firms has spiked.As the nature of outsourced work changes, the Indian advantage may erode further. It is easier for clients to outsource standardised assignments on the periphery of corporate functions to faraway India. It is harder to do so for high-value projects at the heart of their business, which require constant communication, continuity and confidentiality. For these reasons, proximity matters. At the very least, it means being in the same time zone as your client. Infosys and  now operate in more than 40 countries. Infosys has more than 30 outposts across America and is building a new $245m campus in Indiana polis. The firm plans to add 10,000 American workers in the next few years, bringing the total to 35,000. \u201cWe needed capacity closer to the customers,\u201d explains Ravi Kumar, who oversees Infosys\u2019s global services business. Mr Kumar\u2019s own job has relocated from Bengaluru to New York.Still, India accounts for the bulk of its  firms\u2019 workforce. Although the companies are cagey about where their employees are based, securities filings by Infosys and Cognizant show that, give or take, three-quarters of staff are based in India. If India\u2019s entire  industry grew at the same rate as , more or less doubling its workforce this decade, that could mean nearly 5m new Indian white-collar jobs\u2014and potentially 5m fewer in the West.This points to a final hurdle. Amid supply-chain disruptions from the pandemic, now compounded by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, and a geostrategic contest with China, the West is in a . Few politicians would relish millions of well-paid positions moving to India on their watch. Critical visas that once allowed the Indian firms to send star employees abroad to work directly with clients have already grown harder to come by, forcing these positions to be filled locally. Although data can in theory be stored and analysed anywhere, governments are increasingly keen to limit cross-border information flows, often invoking national security. By building a few more campuses in Western countries India\u2019s  titans may alleviate some of those concerns. They are unlikely to make them disappear.

Don\u2019t believe it when he talks about returning to obscurity, though. He sees the withdrawal from Russia not just as a virtuous expression of repugnance against Mr Putin\u2019s murderous regime. It is also a nail in the coffin of globalisation. It would be no surprise if he leads a  crusade against that next.Mr Sonnenfeld is no stranger to the limelight. Indeed, he has become the high priest of a belief system in Western business which he started promoting almost 45 years ago, and which has at last come into fashion. He calls it business ethics. Its critics deride it as \u201cwoke\u201d (\u201cas if there is something wrong with the past participle of awakening,\u201d he harrumphs). There is nothing too woke about why Western firms are pulling out of Russia. Some might call it high-minded but in most cases it is inherently pragmatic. It pleases customers and staff who are outraged by the war, and because Russia is a tiny part of most firms\u2019 global revenues, it is immaterial from an investor point of view.It is a slippery slope, though. Less than a year ago Mr Sonnenfeld was helping whip up scores of s in America in a lather about changes to voting legislation in Georgia and other states. He has celebrated protests by business leaders over gun safety, immigration, climate change and transgender rights. He says that after the corporate pullout from Russia, his most recent powwow with chief executives revealed a sharp increase in their concerns about global supply chains, and a consensus about the need for more self-reliance. In other words, free trade may be next in line on the woke agenda. Amid applause for companies\u2019 quick response to Russian aggression, this ethical mission creep is a worry. Where do bosses draw the line as arbiters of rights and wrongs?In an interview with your columnist, Mr Sonnenfeld elaborates on why he believes Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine will mark a shift in support for globalisation. As he tells it, the era after the fall of the Berlin Wall engendered a \u201cnaive belief\u201d that Western-style capitalism and products like McDonald\u2019s hamburgers would usher in global harmony. Russia\u2019s aggression has buried that notion, he reckons. Asked whether the s he talks to want to change a system that has brought their firms profit, as well as helping lift parts of the world out of poverty, he says they do not want the pendulum to swing back completely to isolationism. But he discerns \u201cdiminished enthusiasm for limitless free trade\u201d.He is not alone in thinking that the war will tilt business opinion against globalisation. In his annual letter to shareholders, Larry Fink, boss of BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest asset manager, said on March 24th that he expected it to prompt companies to re-evaluate their supply chains, probably leading them to bring more of their operations closer to home, even if that means higher costs and margin pressures. Such sentiments gained ground amid the Sino-American trade war during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, then again amid high labour costs and logistical bottlenecks of the covid-19 pandemic. For the time being, statistics that bear out large-scale reshoring are hard to find. But some anecdotal evidence of it is popping up.That may reflect nothing more than business pragmatism in action. More and better automation helps offset the higher wages in developed countries while reducing transport costs. As countries divide themselves into opposing camps, with China and Russia on one side and America and Europe on the other, their governments may encourage firms to invest domestically in vital technologies such as semiconductors to bolster security of supply. If domestic demand for firms\u2019 goods is increasing, or being subsidised, it makes sense for them to meet it. Moreover, pressure by investors to put more focus on environmental, social and governance concerns may spur Western companies to think twice about having extended supply chains in hard-to-monitor places.But when businesses wrap themselves in the flag, rather than standing up for pragmatism (and profits), things become more complicated. As bosses are no doubt aware, when pulling out of Russia, they are leaving the field open to local competitors with no qualms about supporting Mr Putin\u2019s regime. They are abandoning Russian employees who may oppose their government. And their crowd-pleasing stance in Russia may help distract attention from other harmful externalities they are responsible for, such as the carbon footprints of their businesses. As with all ideological positions, there is a kaleidoscope of ways of looking at them.Then there is democracy itself. Mr Sonnenfeld argues that companies are a rare force pressing for social and political change in Western society today. He sees the corporate campaign against Mr Putin\u2019s regime in the same light as divestment from South Africa in the 1980s, which he argues helped bring about the end of apartheid. By being good citizens, firms are upholding and enforcing democratic values. Yet the idea of an unrepresentative coterie of unelected executives making moral choices on behalf of customers and employees could undermine faith in democracy, not shore it up. In a world at risk from autocracies like Russia, that would be a crushing own goal.

A coalition of Swedish music-streamers, South Korean politicians and Dutch dating apps, apparently. They seem to be succeeding where America\u2019s federal government has failed: to force changes to the way Apple and Google run their app stores.The app stores are big businesses, with combined sales last year of $133bn, three times the total five years earlier (see chart). Apple and Google take a cut of up to 30%, which is thought to contribute a fifth of the operating profits at Apple and Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company. The 30% levy began in Apple\u2019s iTunes music store and was copied to its iPhone app store, launched in 2008. As people came to use their phones for gaming, streaming and much else, it evolved into a tax on digital activity. Sign up to a service like Disney+ on your phone and Apple or Google get a cut of your subscription for ever. Apps have had to use the tech duo\u2019s payment systems, and could not tell users about other ways to sign up. Gripes from app developers have forced only minor concessions: last year Apple said it would let them link to external payment pages and Google reduced its fees for subscriptions. Now, though, the dam is bursting.Last summer South Korea banned app stores from forcing developers to use a particular payment system. In December Dutch regulators made a similar ruling against Apple, after a complaint by developers of dating apps. On March 23rd the trend went global. Google announced a deal with Spotify, a vocal critic of app-store fees, to let the music-streamer handle its own billing. Google will lower its commission rate, probably in line with the four-percentage-point cut agreed in South Korea. It says more deals are on the way.Google\u2019s magnanimity anticipates laws that may require bigger concessions. A bill before America\u2019s Congress would force app stores to allow payment alternatives and let apps advertise other ways to sign up. A bigger threat comes from the \u2019s Digital Markets Act (), approved in draft form on March 24th. The colossal bill covers various aspects of digital markets, including app stores. The , which is on track to come into force next year, would force mobile platforms to allow third-party app stores and \u201csideloading\u201d of apps directly from the web\u2014something Google permits but Apple does not. Offenders face fines of up to 20% of worldwide revenue and bans on acquisitions. Breaking open walled gardens, the \u2019s proponents say, will strengthen competition.Apple\u2019s boss, Tim Cook, has warned that sideloading would \u201cdestroy the security of the iPhone\u201d. That is a bit much: Apple allows sideloading on its desktop computers without calamity. But Apple\u2019s much bigger share of the mobile market could make the iPhone a juicier target for malware.

For all firms with brands\u2014and together those brands are worth over $7trn\u2014it is time to realise that influencing is more than just a hobby.The use of personal endorsements used to be about harnessing existing celebrity power. Elizabeth Taylor touted Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s shampoo in the 1950s, and Michael Jordan\u2019s deal in 1984 with Nike revolutionised both basketball and branding. Influencers turn the logic on its head: selling things helps make them more famous. Through curated feeds of clipped videos and filtered photos they offer recommendations to consumers, mingled with glimpses into their daily lives that give their artifice an aura of authenticity. Sometimes they disclose how they are paid. Often they do not.Initially dismissed as credulous Gen-Z folk who had mistaken posting selfies for having a job, these entrepreneurs have become a big business, boosted further by the e-commerce surge from the pandemic. Total spending on influencers by brands could reach $16bn this year. Whereas the number of wannabe influencers outside China is in the millions, an elite of under 100,000 of them who have over 1m followers each get the bulk of revenues and the front seats at fashion shows.Their staying power suggests that they add value in several ways. They can save money: Elon Musk is an honorary influencer whose raucous online presence lets Tesla do without any conventional advertising (General Motors blew $3.3bn on it in 2021). Influencers\u2019 networks reach new audiences, particularly younger shoppers. Global brands can localise their appeal by cutting deals with them. In China local shopping festivals and style sensibilities matter, so transplanting marketing campaigns from the West does not work. And influencers are technologically proficient in a way that old-style brand ambassadors never were. They are quick to adapt to newer platforms like TikTok and to the ever-changing algorithms of older ones like Instagram.Yet one-third of brands do not use influencers. They worry about tarnishing their reputation. Having a swarm of freelance advocates is riskier than the command-and-control campaigns of the \u201cMad Men\u201d era. And the industry is a Wild West, awash with fraud and manipulation.Despite this, ignoring influencers is a mistake. Their share of digital advertising budgets is still low at perhaps 3%, but it is rising fast. The boundary between entertainment and e-commerce is blurring. And the most popular marketing strategy of the 2010s\u2014ads targeted through Google and Facebook\u2014is under threat as new privacy standards, including on Apple\u2019s iPhone, make it harder to spy on potential customers.To get the most out of influencers, brands should set a clear strategy. They should expect more regulation on consumer protection: China\u2019s crackdown may also include limits on spending and content rules. The guiding principle should be to use only influencers who disclose to their audiences that their posts are paid. As the Wild West phase ends, brands should also embrace new analytical tools that help them gauge the performance of influencers, sorting the con-artists from the stars. It used to be said that only half of all advertising spending worked, but it was impossible to know which half.

Burdened by foreign debts and squeezed by the effects of the pandemic on its tourist receipts, Sri Lanka\u2019s government dithered over approaching the  for help as the year began. Now a devaluation of the currency and the impact of the war on commodity markets is sending consumer prices soaring. Troops have been deployed to calm the crowds queuing for fuel, and a debt default may be unavoidable. As the prices of everything from oil and gas to corn and wheat surge, other countries may fear a similar fate.Food makes up a modest share of households\u2019 budgets in the rich world, but accounts for more than 20% of consumer spending across most of the emerging world and about 40% in sub-Saharan Africa. Prices had already risen substantially over the past couple of years, owing to interruptions to production and extreme weather. Global food prices, in real terms, approached an all-time high in February, according to an index maintained by the  Food and Agriculture Organisation. They will have only gone up further since.One consequence of this is a surge in poverty. The Centre for Global Development, a think-tank, estimates that 40m people worldwide will be pushed into extreme poverty as a result of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. (By comparison, the World Bank estimated in 2021 that roughly 100m people may have fallen into poverty because of the covid-19 pandemic.) High commodity prices will also add to macroeconomic strains in many places.Total debt across emerging and developing economies stood at a 50-year high last year, relative to . The cost of servicing those borrowings is rising, as central banks worldwide begin pushing up interest rates in order to check inflation. The tough economic conditions are weighing on emerging-market currencies, raising the cost of foreign-currency debt and forcing governments to drain currency reserves in order to shore up exchange rates. Higher commodity prices could also further complicate the fiscal picture for emerging economies, given that many governments offer generous food and energy subsidies to households.Sri Lanka\u2019s case is illustrative. Its foreign-exchange reserves shrank from more than $8bn in 2019 to around $2bn earlier this year. Though the government has sought aid from both India and China, it will almost certainly require help from the , with which it is expected to begin negotiations in April (and which may ask for a reduction in subsidies as part of any rescue package).Egypt has also struggled. It imports nearly two-thirds of the wheat it consumes, the vast majority of which comes from Russia and Ukraine. At a pre-pandemic level of consumption, Egypt\u2019s annual bill for food and energy imports amounts to about 40% of its foreign-exchange reserves (see chart). Sensing trouble, foreign investors began pulling money out of the country, which in turn forced the government to devalue the currency by 14%. On March 23rd it officially sought the \u2019s help.According to estimates by the World Bank, at least a dozen countries may find themselves unable to service debts over the next 12 months, as stores of hard currency run low. Some south Asian and north African economies are in danger; Pakistan and Tunisia look particularly vulnerable. Even emerging markets with healthier financial positions can expect to face slower growth, higher inflation and grumpier citizens as a result of Russia\u2019s war.The news is not all grim. Economies that specialise in the production of the commodities most disrupted by the war stand to reap some benefit from soaring prices. Oil-exporting Gulf states will collect a windfall, which higher prices for imported foodstuffs will only partly offset. Some Latin American currencies have appreciated since the outbreak of war, in expectation of higher earnings for their oil and grain exports. In 2021 Brazil seemed to be slipping into crisis, weighed down by high inflation and fiscal profligacy. The war has given the country, which is a big commodity exporter, a reprieve. For much of the rest of the world, though, it has been anything but.

{"title": "What next for Russia?", "content": "WHEN RUSSIAN and Ukrainian negotiators met in Istanbul to discuss a potential settlement on March 29th Alexander Fomin, Russia\u2019s deputy defence minister, had something to offer. \u201cIn order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations,\u201d he said, Russia would \u201cdrastically reduce\u201d operations around Kyiv and Chernihiv, a city 150km to the north. and Ukrainian negotiators met in Istanbul to discuss a potential settlement on March 29th Alexander Fomin, Russia\u2019s deputy defence minister, had something to offer. \u201cIn order to increase mutual trust and create the necessary conditions for further negotiations,\u201d he said, Russia would \u201cdrastically reduce\u201d operations around Kyiv and Chernihiv, a city 150km to the north.According to previous Russian announcements, backing off from Ukraine\u2019s capital was not a gesture of much consequence. \u201cOur main aim,\u201d a trio of generals said at a defence-ministry briefing on March 25th, had always been \u201cliberating Donbas\u201d\u2014two Russian speaking provinces in the east of the country. Before the invasion the Russian proxies in the two \u201cPeople\u2019s Republics\u201d of Donetsk and Luhansk had occupied about a third of Donbas. Russian troops have since grabbed more of the territory, including parts of Mariupol, a now ruined port on the Sea of Azov. This meant that the \u201cmain tasks of the first stage of the operation\u201d had been completed. The assault on Kyiv, in this telling, had been a mere feint designed to distract Ukrainian forces from the real action in Donbas.Bunkum. Abundant evidence from a range of sources, including pre-cooked Russian media reports published in error, shows that Russia both intended to take Kyiv and expected to do so quickly. Ukrainians claim to have found dress uniforms presumably packed for victory parades. But a pincer movement from the north-west and north-east of the capital met fierce Ukrainian resistance and suffered from jammed up supply lines.Now Russian forces in the area are pulling back, blowing up bridges behind them to ward off counterattacks. Well-placed officials from two Western countries say that Russia has probably made a strategic decision to cut its losses: \u201cIt is going to be a genuine withdrawal,\u201d says one. The retreat may be real rather than a ruse. But it is not a gracious gesture and it is not a cunning, far-sighted plan. It is a startling defeat.Nor is it the only one. Towards the end of March Ukraine\u2019s army mounted a series of increasingly ambitious and effective counterattacks, including towards Kherson in the south, the only big city the Russians currently occupy. Some of these appear to have been devastatingly effective. Battles around Myrhorod, roughly half way between Kyiv and Kharkiv, 400km east, are thought to have resulted in severe losses for Russia\u2019s 4th Guards Tank Division. The unit is part of the army\u2019s elite 1st Guards Tank Army and operates some of Russia\u2019s most modern armour. Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting, a research group, thinks the division has lost at least a fifth of its tanks.Spreading the invasion over four separate salients\u2014a push south from Belarus to Kyiv, one out of Russia towards Sumy and Kharkiv in Ukraine\u2019s north-east, one from further east into Donbas and a fourth north out of Crimea\u2014was always going to leave Russian forces overstretched. They have paid a heavy price. Though Russia claims that only 1,351 of its soldiers have died, on March 30th Victoria Nuland, an official in America\u2019s State Department, said that the true figure was more than 10,000. (Ukrainian officials put the number at more than 15,000.) The last army to lose soldiers on that scale in the course of a month was Iraq\u2019s in 2003. Morale is, understandably, poor. Jeremy Fleming, the head of , Britain\u2019s signals-intelligence agency, says there is clear evidence of Russian soldiers \u201crefusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft\u201d.The Russian army's failures and shortcomings do not make it a spent force. Though its spokes-generals were lying when they said that they had never really wanted Kyiv, they were accurate when saying that they had made progress in Donbas, and may have been truthful in saying that that was where their efforts would now be focused. A researcher at the Conflict Intelligence Team, an investigative group, says that by pouring in troops from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy and elsewhere Russia can probably muster enough manpower in Donbas to outnumber the Ukrainian forces there, perhaps by 50% or so: a significant margin, if not necessarily an overwhelming one.In recent weeks, Russian forces have attempted to move south from the north bank of the Donets river in Izyum, a town 125km south-east of Kharkiv, at the same time as they advance north along a front that stretches from the outskirts of Zaporizhia, on the Dnieper, to Mariupol on the coast. This looks like an attempt to isolate the Ukrainian troops fighting Russian proxies in Donbas\u2014what Ukraine calls the Joint Forces Operation (Before the war the  consisted of ten particularly well equipped and trained brigades, all of them battle hardened. Some of those troops were redeployed to fight invaders elsewhere. How many of them remain in the area, and what condition they are in, is very hard to gauge. But one credible estimate has two-fifths of Ukraine\u2019s army still in the area. Were the Russians to cut those forces off and, thanks to numerical advantage and the tactical edge provided by encirclement, defeat them, it would be a huge blow to Ukraine. It would provide Mr Putin\u2019s army with a solid base for further gains along the coast in the south, providing a continuous connection from Donbas to Crimea and maybe more. It might even lead the Russians to look again at Kyiv and the regime change they claim not to have wanted.So far Russia\u2019s advance through Kharkiv has been slow, grinding and, again, costly. Its forces have struggled to cross rivers\u2014here, it is Ukraine that has blown up bridges\u2014and to travel off-road. As to the northward advance, it has yet to get past Huliaipole, a city more or less midway between Mariupol and Zaporizhia. This means that the jaws of the trap, if such they are, are a good 250km apart. \u201cIt's an easy thing to draw some arrows on a map and write the word \u2018envelop\u2019 on it,\u201d says one Western official. \u201cIt's a fundamentally different thing to try and achieve that on the ground.\u201dIf or, more realistically, when besieged Mariupol falls, Russia will have more troops to commit to the advance, though they may be battered and exhausted. But it will also need to fix a range of other deficits, including problems using air power. Its planes still seem unable to track and hit moving targets, for example. And it will need to improve its woeful logistics. Encircling the  will require much longer supply lines than any Russia has made use of so far in its campaign.It will also have to deal with the risk of further and perhaps more ambitious counterattacks by Ukraine. The possibility of taking the fight to the enemy in this way is probably one reason why Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, is insistently asking its supporters in the West for heavier kit, including tanks, armoured personnel carriers and combat aircraft.Some officials think that Mr Zelensky is asking for kit his country does not need, and is unlikely to get, so as to have a better bargaining position when it comes to things he really wants, such as more advanced air-defence systems. Others reckon that he needs to replenish his depleted stocks; there is no clear sense outside the country of how much materiel Ukraine has lost. But tanks would also support more ambitious Ukrainian counter-offensives, and given the success of some counter-offensives so far, it would be strange to think that was not part of the genuine rationale. As Mr Zelensky said  with , planes and tanks would \u201callow us to unblock Russian-occupied cities, to bring food to residents there, to take the military initiative into our own hands\u201d.There are hundreds of Soviet-made tanks in the arsenals of former Warsaw Pact members now in , most of which would be familiar enough to Ukrainian tank crews for them just to hop in and drive off. There are also Soviet-built i fighter jets, which Poland, in particular, initially seemed keen to hand over, but which America declined to help deliver. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at what we can do,\u201d said Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, after a  summit on March 24th, \u201cbut\u2026logistically at the moment it looks very difficult with both armour and jets.\u201dLogistics are not the only issue. Emmanuel Macron, France\u2019s president, has declared that providing Ukraine with tanks and planes would cross a \u201cred line\u201d, turning  into a \u201cco-belligerent\u201d. But Mr Zelensky does not accept this argument, insisting that those who espouse it are simply afraid of Mr Putin.Even if Ukraine were to get more tanks, though, they might not provide it with quite the advantage that is being looked for. Tanks remain necessary for some sorts of action. At the same time, as the past weeks have shown, they are increasingly vulnerable. \u201cOne thing that I'm taking away from this war is that, in land warfare, the defence remains all-powerful,\u201d says Billy Fabian, a former infantry officer now at , an American think-tank. Defenders require fewer forces, chew through less ammunition and fuel and suffer fewer losses. What is more, anti-tank weapons have got a lot better. Ukraine has benefited from that dynamic thus far. If it were forced to manoeuvre and supply forces over longer distances, Russian forces might be able to do as they were done to.The balance of defence versus offence; the ability to keep supply lines open; the morale and willingness to fight of the opposing side; the capacity to \u201cclose the skies\u201d. If there is to be a large, decisive clash in Donbas it could turn on any one of those factors. But what would come after?If Russia were to emerge with the upper hand, it might continue the war. It might alternatively use the win as an exit strategy. With Donbas \u201cliberated\u201d, Russia could declare its \u201cspecial operation\u201d to be a famous victory. With Ukraine\u2019s army dealt a heavy blow it might prove possible for Russia to achieve quite a lot of its broader goals with regard to its victim\u2019s future status through negotiation.If negotiations failed, Russia could garrison troops in Donbas for years, as it has done in the \u201cfrozen conflicts\u201d in Moldova and Georgia. (On March 30th a Russian-backed breakaway statelet in Georgia, South Ossetia, said it would seek to join Russia.) But if Russia held the territory without a deal, it would find itself locked in a protracted struggle. Ukrainian counterattacks would be relentless. Western countries\u2014buoyed by Ukraine\u2019s resilience, surprised by their own solidarity and wary of setting a precedent for other aggressors\u2014would continue applying pressure. Britain and Poland both said this week that they would oppose lifting sanctions until Russia withdrew entirely.Not an ideal situation. But better for Russia than the outcome should it seek a decisive victory in Donbas and fail. If that were to happen, the generals of spin would need to find a whole new war aim to claim to have been following all along.

It was March 15th, the day Hungary commemorates its revolution of 1848. On the stage Peter Marki-Zay, the opposition candidate for prime minister, was invoking history. In 1848, 1956 and 1989, when the communists were finally ousted, Hungarians had been \u201con the right side\u201d, he said. Now they were embarrassed by their country, which had become the fief of one man: Viktor Orban.In 12 years as prime minister Mr Orban had split the nation and enriched only his own supporters. He had turned Hungary towards Russia and autocracy, and away from Europe and the rule of law. Mr Marki-Zay promised support for the  and  in Ukraine, inclusion for gay people and an economy based on merit rather than political connections. Hungarian, Ukrainian,  and rainbow flags waved in the crowd.Across the river Mr Orban was addressing a far bigger throng with a very different message. The annual government-sponsored \u201cPeace March\u201d had been turned into a rally for the ruling party, Fidesz. \u201cIt is not in our interests to become casualties in someone else\u2019s war,\u201d Mr Orban said. Ukraine\u2019s refugees deserved help (something he did not say about migrants from Syria in 2014-15), but he would not let arms be transferred through Hungary or accept sanctions on Russian energy that hurt its economy. The opposition would drag Hungary into the war, in which it would be a mere pawn on the chessboard of America and Russia. He would stay out\u2014and stop \u201cgender madness\u201d too. Here the flags were of Hungary or Fidesz; the few blue-and-yellow ones were not Ukrainian, but the banner of Romania\u2019s ethnic Hungarians.Hungary\u2019s election on April 3rd is more than a routine vote in a small central-European country. Because Mr Orban is a hero to many right-wing populists in Europe and America, it is a crucial test for them. The war in Ukraine adds an extra dimension. The Hungarian leader has long-established ties to Vladimir Putin, and has emerged as the most reluctant member of the coalition against him. Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, singled him out in a speech on March 24th to the European Council, demanding that he and Hungary \u201cdecide which side you are on\u201d.That casts the election as part of a global struggle between liberal democracy and populist autocracy. Hungary is still a democracy, but in his three consecutive terms Mr Orban has undermined democratic norms. The media, the courts, the education system and other institutions are largely controlled by Fidesz or by friendly oligarchs. In 2014 Mr Orban spoke of turning Hungary into an \u201cilliberal state\u201d. It has since become the only  country rated by Freedom House, a watchdog, as only \u201cpartly free\u201d rather than \u201cfree\u201d.Mr Orban\u2019s allies see themselves as patriotic Christian conservatives, fighting an alliance of globalists who want to erase national traditions and swamp Europe with migrants. Their  are the European Commission and George Soros, a Hungarian-born billionaire and liberal philanthropist. Mr Orban\u2019s critics think his main goals are actually financial. His relatives and friends in business have become hugely wealthy; much  aid ends up going to them. To its opponents Orbanism looks like Putinism-light: single-party rule without the need for violence.The popularity of Mr Orban and Fidesz is genuine and striking. In the past two elections they have drawn about half the vote, while a fragmented opposition split the rest. That was enough to give Fidesz a two-thirds majority in parliament, because it had twisted the electoral system to its own advantage (see ).A rule change in 2012 shrank parliament and raised the share of single-candidate districts, which naturally favour the biggest party, from 176 of 386 seats to 106 of 199. The rest are determined by proportional representation. It also gerrymandered those districts. In 2020 the government made things even tougher, requiring parties to run candidates in at least 71 districts to get on the proportional ballot.Last year, fear of Mr Orban\u2019s growing control finally made the opposition co-operate. Two centrist parties, Democratic Coalition and Momentum Movement, a hard-right party, Jobbik, the centre-left Socialists and the progressive Green and Dialogue parties have fielded a single list under the rubric United for Hungary. They ran primaries last October for each single-candidate seat and nationally for the job of prime minister. Mr Marki-Zay, an independent conservative who is mayor of a small city, came out on top.Such cross-party alliances have unseated populist leaders in other countries, including Israel\u2019s Binyamin Netanyahu and the Czech Republic\u2019s Andrej Babis. Yet in Hungary Mr Marki-Zay\u2019s chances are not good. Because of the mixed electoral system,  calculates the opposition needs to win about 54% of the vote to get a majority in parliament. Polls show them trailing Fidesz by about 50% to 44%.One reason is Mr Orban\u2019s domination of the media. He has turned the country\u2019s state-backed outlets into propaganda megaphones. Nearly all of the country\u2019s big private news sources have been bought by oligarchs friendly to the government. Most were donated in 2018 to a foundation headed by an ally of Fidesz.Of the plucky outfits that remained, several have since been throttled. Klub radio, a liberal station in Budapest, had its broadcast licence denied in 2020. Index.hu was the country\u2019s most-visited news website until a new owner with links to Mr Orban took over in 2021 and fired its editor-in-chief. \u201cI knew Index would eventually be captured, the only question was when,\u201d says Veronika Munk, who used to be deputy editor. The staff quit and founded a new outlet called Telex, but it has less than half the audience. Other independent websites are read mostly inside the liberal bubble.Hence the opposition is struggling to be heard. The two main  news channels, one public and one owned by a government ally, give opposition candidates less than a quarter the speaking time of those from Fidesz, according to Mertek, a media watchdog. Only  Klub, a popular foreign-owned channel, presents even-handed news coverage. For months before the election, roadsides were lined with placards of Mr Orban and his slogan \u201cForward, not back\u201d. These were put up not by Fidesz but by the government. Other posters, some paid for by a murky foundation funded by state-owned companies, portrayed Mr Marki-Zay as the \u201cmini-me\u201d of Ferenc Gyurcsany, an unpopular former prime minister, or depicted the opposition candidates as a \u201cGyurcsany Show\u201d. (The Democratic Coalition\u2019s entry in the primary was Klara Dobrev, Mr Gyurcsany\u2019s wife.)That leaves social media and \u201cknocking on doors\u201d, says Anna Donath, an opposition . Yet during the primary Fidesz\u2019s social-media spending outweighed the combined budgets of all opposition candidates. Campaign spending limits kicked in on February 12th, and since then the two sides have spent roughly the same amount on advertising. But lots of Facebook ads have been bought by a sketchy new party created in December by the wealthy Hungarian owner of LiveJasmin, a pornography website. The opposition thinks it is a decoy intended to divide the anti-Fidesz vote.Fidesz makes use of every conceivable government resource for the campaign. In January people who had registered for vaccinations against covid-19 began receiving pro-government emails. A national referendum has been scheduled on the same day as the election. It asks questions like \u201cDo you support the unrestricted exposure of underage children to sexually explicit media content that may affect their development?\u201d\u2014falsely insinuating that the opposition does.In poor rural areas, officials are told that if their municipality does not vote for Fidesz there will be no government jobs. After Budapest had the temerity to elect Gergely Karacsony of the Dialogue party as mayor in 2019, the national government slashed a local tax on businesses, depriving the city of about 20% of its budget, and vetoed a loan from the European Investment Bank to upgrade its trams. Mr Orban wants \u201cto squeeze the city, and then portray the mayor as incompetent,\u201d says David Koranyi, an adviser to Mr Karacsony.The voting rules are biased, too. Mr Orban gave ethnic Hungarians in neighbouring countries the right to vote, along with pensions and other benefits; so most vote for Fidesz. They can vote by post, whereas \u00e9migr\u00e9s (who tend to vote for the opposition) must travel to consulates. There are some concerns about secret balloting and counting votes. But a civil-society group has trained more than 20,000 vote-watchers, enough for the opposition to send two to every precinct in the country.Some tricks are just old-fashioned politics. The government has raised the minimum wage by 20% and paid an unexpected 13th month of pension benefits. Last year Mr Orban eliminated income tax for under-25s, and this year he gave a rebate to every family with children up to the amount paid by an average worker. Zoltan Kovacs, the government\u2019s spokesman, says it wants to reward families and thus raise the birth rate. But like much Hungarian tax policy, the freebies reward the middle class more than the poor, notes Daniel Prinz of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.The handouts will also accelerate inflation, which is projected to hit 9% this year, says Peter Virovacz of  Bank. The government has capped the prices of basic foods and fuel, leading to shortages at petrol stations. Economic growth is strong, though the war in Ukraine has cut forecasts for this year to perhaps 4.5%. Unemployment is a scant 3.8%. The next government, though, will probably need to make unpleasant cuts.The economy is Mr Orban\u2019s justification for resisting energy sanctions on Russia. In February he travelled to Moscow and extended a long-term gas contract with Gazprom. The terms are secret, but Mr Orban says they are very beneficial. Responding to Mr Zelensky\u2019s criticism, he claimed that without Russian gas and oil Hungary\u2019s economy would \u201cgrind to a halt\u201d. (The country\u2019s dependency on Russian energy is high, but not unusually so for central Europe.) In 2014 Mr Orban struck a deal with Rosatom to upgrade Hungary\u2019s nuclear power plant that entails billions of dollars in Russian loans.For some of its troubles the opposition has itself to blame. It has not found a central theme to hammer away at. The party leaders have campaigned like \u201csix dwarves\u201d, says Gabor Toka, a political scientist. Mr Marki-Zay is more right-wing than most of his alliance, and is prone to odd lines of attack, such as unconvincingly charging the government with sending arms to Ukraine. ( planes based in Hungary are carrying out deliveries, but only between other countries.)That partly reflects the coalition\u2019s breadth. Dialogue is an urban party that strongly supports gay rights. Jobbik is a rural nationalist party that used to engage in anti-Roma racism. The lack of conflict between such parties during the campaign is striking. Opposition voters, too, seem willing to set aside ideology. \u201cI am economically more free-market, but that doesn\u2019t matter now. The point is to get democracy back,\u201d said Ben Tordai, a student at the rally on March 15th.For all Mr Orban\u2019s rhetoric about energy prices, his policy on Ukraine reflects a philosophical difference from other Europeans. \u201cHungary is a country in the buffer zone\u201d between Russia and the West, says Zoltan Kiszelly of the Szazadveg Foundation, a pro-government think-tank. \u201cWe fought four wars with Russia and lost all of them. We don\u2019t want to try for a fifth. The Poles had a much worse history, but they want to try one more time.\u201dThis position is starting to hurt Hungary. Mr Orban was once seen as a leader of a group of populist governments across central Europe. Poland is a close ally: its Law and Justice party has imitated Mr Orban by trying to take over its courts and media. The  is imposing penalties on both for eroding the rule of law. They rely on each other\u2019s vetoes to quash further sanctions. But Law and Justice is vociferously anti-Putin. On March 26th Andrzej Duda, Poland\u2019s president, said Mr Orban\u2019s policy would \u201ccost Hungarians a lot\u201d.

When Israel\u2019s first prime minister died in 1973, after years of retirement in Sde Boker, a sleepy kibbutz deep in the Negev desert, his country had just emerged from another war with its angry Arab neighbours. None recognised Israel\u2019s existence. No doubt he would have been shocked by the scene half a century later: a few miles from his tomb, the foreign ministers of four Arab states\u2014Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates ()\u2014met their Israeli and American counterparts at a hotel in Sde Boker on March 27th, clasped hands amid smiles (pictured above), then tucked into kebabs together.It was the second notable Middle Eastern gathering in a week, after a meeting in Sharm al-Sheikh between the leaders of Egypt, Israel and the . Save Egypt, none of the Arab participants had formal relations with Israel until 2020. That they met, warmly and openly, showed how low the Palestinian cause has fallen on the agenda of Arab governments (if not their citizens). For Israel, it was another impressive step, albeit symbolic, towards its widening acceptance as a normal regional power.The twin summits were part of a broader flurry of diplomacy, some of it rooted in a feeling that America is no longer a reliable partner. The meeting in Sharm al-Sheikh showed that America\u2019s partners can co-ordinate their own positions; the gathering in Israel was a chance to share those concerns with Antony Blinken, America\u2019s secretary of state. It says much about the troubled state of America\u2019s regional relations that Mr Blinken flew out to Israel for three days as war was raging in Ukraine.Chief among those concerns is Iran. Gulf countries grumble that America has not protected them from Iranian-made rockets and drones. Since January these have hit oil installations in Saudi Arabia and killed civilians in the . Israel and the Gulf leaders think America is close to rejoining the nuclear deal struck in 2015 with Iran, which Donald Trump ditched in 2018. They fear it may only briefly delay Iran\u2019s nuclear plans and give it an economic windfall to spend on regional mischief.Rob Malley, the lead American negotiator, is more guarded about prospects for a deal. \u201cYou could be close, you could be close for a very long time, and you could never get there,\u201d he says. Still, one Israeli diplomat says, the Negev summit was meant \u201cto ensure that, whether the Americans and the Iranians sign a deal or it all blows up, we will still have a joint strategy with the administration on how to deal with Iran the day after\u201d.For his part, Mr Blinken used the summit to prod his fellow ministers to boost oil output and join sanctions on Russia. They have little incentive to do either. Israel does not want to jeopardise its military co-operation with Russia in Syria, where it carries out air strikes against Iran and its proxies. The , the world\u2019s seventh-biggest oil producer, is a member of the so-called  agreement, in which Russia is a key player. The \u2019s energy minister said this week he would refuse to do \u201csomething unilateral\u201d to increase output.So neither side got what it wanted in the Negev. There were no firm promises. But the mere act of meeting was enough, certainly for Israel. Though it has had diplomatic relations with Egypt since 1979 and Jordan since 1994, public summits with their leaders have been rare, stilted affairs.The informality of the Negev summit, at which the delegations slept in the same hotel and dined together, was a sign of the changing atmosphere in swathes of the Middle East. Last year\u2019s removal of Binyamin Netanyahu after 12 years as prime minister, orchestrated by Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, now the prime and foreign ministers, did much to improve Israel\u2019s regional ties, and not only with Arab states.Turkey has spent the past decade at odds with Israel, Egypt and the , largely because of its vociferous and vigorous support for political Islam. It is now eager to mend those rifts. On March 9th Recep Tayyip Erdogan, its president, hosted his Israeli counterpart, Isaac Herzog, for the first such visit since 2007. A month earlier he had been in Abu Dhabi dining with the Emirati crown prince.The change of government in Israel gave Mr Erdogan a chance to change his tone towards it. So does the prospect of exporting natural gas buried under Israel\u2019s Mediterranean waters. Turkey\u2019s economic ties with the  may improve, too. Elsewhere, Egypt and the Gulf states have buried their feud with Qatar, which had enraged them by backing Islamists across the region. The  is even courting Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s dictator, hoping to diminish his reliance on Iran.There were notable absentees in the Negev. One was Saudi Arabia, which has not established ties with Israel. But it shares many of the same concerns about Iran, and was certainly there in spirit. \u201cYou don\u2019t get in a room with Emiratis and the Bahrainis without having the Saudis\u2019 approval,\u201d says an Israeli diplomat. Many Saudis expect Muhammad bin Salman, the crown prince, to recognise Israel once he is king.Also absent, of course, were the Palestinians. Not only were they not invited, but their long conflict with Israel, once the  of Middle Eastern diplomats, got little more than a passing mention. They made do with a visit from King Abdullah of Jordan, who travelled to Ramallah, their de facto capital, to meet Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinians\u2019 ageing president.The Negev summit was also a reminder that there are no easy answers when it comes to Iran. If America does not know how to find one, neither do its regional partners. In the short term they will probably work together to boost military co-operation and missile defences. Participants in the Negev suggested making it a regular forum, to be convened annually in a desert location. An American diplomat joked that, with old enemies now gambling on new alliances, it could be Las Vegas.

Such people are liable also to think that non-Italian ingredients have no place on a pizza, or that using Italian rather than Tunisian olive oil in couscous is a grave culinary sin.A taco, these diners will explain (often without being asked), consists of paired soft tortillas, typically made of corn. These are wrapped around a modest amount of meat, usually braised, with a sprinkling of chopped raw onion, a couple of sprigs of coriander and a squirt of salsa\u2014the spicier the better. Made well, these are indeed delicious, with an almost Japanese austerity that lets every ingredient shine and complement each other.What innumerable Americans know as a taco\u2014a hard-shell tortilla that comes in boxes on grocery shelves, stuffed to bursting with ground meat cooked in mass-market seasoning, topped with orangey mass-produced cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and mild salsa from a jar\u2014bears little relation to this \u201creal thing\u201d. So, the authenticity-policing diners argue, it should be shunned and mocked.This is a joyless way to eat. Chubby, crackly American tacos may be unknown in Culiac\u00e1n or Toluca, but they taste good. They may well seem \u201cinauthentic\u201d in Mexico, but they are deeply authentic in the minds and memories of millions in America. Korean tacos\u2014tortillas filled with Korean-seasoned barbecued meat and kimchi\u2014are also little known in Mexico. But they emerged authentically from the marriage of Korean and Mexican cultures and cuisines in multicultural Los Angeles.That is how food develops. Being the original progenitor of a recipe may merit some bragging rights at the dining table, but nothing more. Legend has it that Marco Polo brought noodles back to Italy from China: that does not make spaghetti just bastardised except in the way that all foods (and people) are hybrid and derivative. Lebanese emigrants brought lamb cooked upright on a rotating spit with them to Mexico. Decades and countless chillies, onions and pineapples later, Mexicans turned shawarma into .Judging dishes by their authenticity ignores the development that follows naturally as food and people migrate. It also encourages unwelcome stereotyping. In 2019 Sara Kay, a culinary consultant, studied 20,000 online reviews of restaurants in New York, and found \u201cauthentic\u201d to be associated with \u201cdirt floors [and] plastic stools\u201d when describing non-European restaurants. For European eateries, it meant elegant decor.That exemplifies the common but regrettable belief that non-European food should be cheap and served in tatty surroundings\u2014even when the cuisines in question are intricate and delicious. In the end, whether someone considers a food authentic says more about their own biases than about what is on their plate.

On his desk he found two documents. One warned that a feared Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic, was imminent.

On his desk he found two documents. One warned that a feared Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic, was imminent. The other concluded that Britain could do precious little about it. Leach, a tall man with a bluff manner, had other ideas, and stormed off to find the prime minister.The First Sea Lord found Margaret Thatcher in the House of Commons, closeted with ministers and officials. The atmosphere, he later recalled, was one of \u201ccomplete gloom\u201d. Thatcher asked whether he thought they could retake the Falklands. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered decisively, against all the advice she was getting. \u201cAnd in my judgment, we .\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d snapped Thatcher. \u201cBecause if we do not,\u201d Leach replied, \u201cif we muck around, if we pussyfoot\u2026in a very few months\u2019 time we shall be living in a different country whose word will count for little.\u201dThatcher gave Leach a \u201ccold stare\u201d, and then cracked a grin. Leach had given the prime minister her mission. Argentina invaded the islands on April 2nd; a British naval task force set sail a few days later.Forty years on, the Falklands war still resonates\u2014especially among Conservatives. It changed both Thatcher\u2019s fortunes and the post-war narrative of Britain\u2019s decline. And it happened at a formative time for the current generation of political leaders: Boris Johnson, the prime minister, was 17 when Argentina invaded.The most immediate consequence of the war, which cost the lives of 649 Argentinian and 255 British servicemen, was to transform Thatcher\u2019s premiership. She captured and channelled an outpouring of patriotic pride in the successes of the armed forces 8,000 miles away. At the end of 1981 Gallup, a polling outfit, put the Conservative Party\u2019s approval rating at just 23%; by the time the Argentines surrendered on June 14th it was around 50%.A thumping majority for Thatcher at the next election, in May 1983, was not due only to the war: a feeble opposition and a recovering economy helped. But without the \u201cFalklands factor\u201d she would have been hard-pressed to win a majority of any size. As it was, she exploited her strengthened mandate to take on and face down militant trade unionism.The change in mood was captured by one of the banners slung off the side of the  by Royal Marines as the converted cruise ship returned to Southampton: \u201c\u201d. Even those who had opposed the war conceded that the political environment had changed. One tribune of the left, Tony Benn, accepted that \u201cwe have just come to the end of an era.\u201dThe longer-term cultural consequences also mattered, especially for Conservative and right-of-centre politicians. Defending the rights of the Falkland Islanders to determine their own future was Thatcher\u2019s immediate but, as Leach had suggested, for Britain there was much more at stake. Decline had been the  of post-war British politics as the country slipped inexorably down the economic and diplomatic league tables.No one felt this more painfully than Thatcher herself, elected prime minister in 1979. \u201cI can\u2019t Britain in decline. I just can\u2019t,\u201d she wailed to the  before polling day that year. \u201cWe, who either defeated or rescued half Europe, who kept half Europe free, when otherwise it would be in chains! And look at us now!\u201d Doing nothing in response to the Argentine invasion would have confirmed this sorry picture.Instead, argues Dominic Sandbrook, a historian and author of \u201cWho Dares Wins: Britain 1979-1982\u201d, a \u201cdeeply buried sense of national exceptionalism began to stir\u201d. A new generation was less bashful about expressing a sense of pride in Britain and its historic role in the world. Many of those who had favoured Britain\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community (as it then was) in 1973 had argued that the country needed to join the trade bloc because of its relative weakness.Lord David Owen, then a leader of the centrist Social Democratic Party, argues that the Falklands conflict \u201cchanged Britain\u201d, suggesting that Britain could look at different options. \u201cThere is a line that goes from the war to Brexit,\u201d he says. Nigel Farage, who corralled Euroscepticism into a political movement, also remembers \u201ca massive upsurge in patriotism\u201d after the war and a renewal of \u201cnational self-confidence\u201d. Here were the \u201cseeds\u201d for the founding of the United Kingdom Independence Party in 1993.The Falklands conflict also reshaped the template for political leadership. Thatcher herself listened much less, believing that only the application of an iron will could succeed. And the war entrenched the idea of politics as a Manichean contest of resolution versus appeasement, freedom versus oppression. That contest has a renewed salience now.In a speech given to Conservative Party members last month, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, explicitly invoked Thatcher\u2019s leadership to yoke the events of 40 years ago to a much more significant conflict. \u201cShe equipped the forces with the most important weapon of all\u2014the moral component\u2026that deep sense that what we were fighting for was legal, justified and right,\u201d said Mr Wallace. \u201cToday that same moral component is what is arming the men and women of Ukraine.\u201d The Falklands war may have been over quickly, but the narratives it spawned live on.

Ukrainians are shelling their own cities. A Jewish president is actually a Nazi. Dictators have always told lies, so the Kremlin\u2019s recent whoppers have precedent. Dictators have often used terror, too, so what Vladimir Putin is doing to civilians in Ukraine is nothing new, either. But the balance between lying and killing has changed, argues a fascinating new book. For most modern autocrats, lying matters more.In \u201cSpin Dictators\u201d, Sergei Guriev, a Russian economist living in exile, and Daniel Treisman, a political scientist, describe how this shift has occurred. For much of the 20th century, despots were ostentatiously violent. Hitler, Stalin and Mao slew millions. Lesser monsters such as Mobutu Sese Seko, a Congolese tyrant, hanged cabinet ministers in public. The aim was to terrify people into submission.The authors contrast such \u201cfear dictators\u201d with \u201cspin dictators\u201d, who kill fewer people, and deny it when they do. The latter are now more common. Among autocrats who took power in the 1960s, roughly a quarter killed more than 100 dissidents a year; among those who took power in the 2000s, less than a tenth did.Spin dictators pretend to be democrats. They hold multiparty elections and seldom claim to have won more than 90% of the vote, as was the norm for non-democracies in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. They rig less and gerrymander more. In 2018 Viktor Orban, Hungary\u2019s spinner-in-chief, turned less than half the vote for his party into a two-thirds supermajority in parliament. He will be  at the election on April 3rd.Fear dictators\u2019 propaganda was crude and relentless. Busts of Stalin were placed on 38 mountain peaks in Central Asia. So many Mao badges were produced that China\u2019s aircraft industry ran short of aluminium. It was often absurd, too. Mussolini and Kim Jong Il could supposedly conjure up rain and teleport from place to place, respectively. This absurdity was itself a weapon, demonstrating the regime\u2019s \u201ccapacity to force people to repeat nonsense\u201d.Spin dictators like to project an image of competence. Nursultan Nazarbayev used to address Kazakhs from behind a stack of papers, reading out lists of bread-and-butter policies and chiding his ministers for not serving the public better. Spin dictators seldom have a coherent ideology, but use humour to paint themselves as noble and their opponents as vile. They even weaponise light entertainment. In Peru under Alberto Fujimori, a Jerry Springer-style show featured screaming guests, allegations of infidelity and calm words from the host praising the president.Censorship under fear dictators was total. When an impure snippet found its way into an agricultural paper in the Soviet Union, \u201ccensors raced to track down every copy sold, including 50 already pasted into ersatz wallpaper and 12 used as toilet paper.\u201d Spin dictators, by contrast, let a few highbrow, low-circulation dissident papers survive, to show they respect freedom of speech. Meanwhile, independent broadcasters are crippled with spurious tax demands and then bought by the president\u2019s cronies. Critics are harassed with libel suits or fined for spreading \u201cfake news\u201d. Ecuador\u2019s former president, Rafael Correa, forced documentaries off the web by suing for unauthorised use of his picture. Authoritarian leaders who manipulate, rather than censor, the media are typically more popular than democratic ones who face a genuinely free press.The goal of a spin dictator is to appear to allow political competition while making it nearly impossible in practice. Rather than criminalising dissent, he imprisons his opponents for non-political crimes, such as fraud or rape, of which they are innocent. Sometimes he locks them up for short periods, so they do not become martyrs, and often, so their work is constantly disrupted. Rather than banning opposition parties, he tangles them in red tape or bankrupts them with fines and lawsuits. For extra deniability, the task of making dissidents\u2019 lives hell can be outsourced to a youth militia or army of online trolls, who may rough them up, publish their addresses or leak embarrassing photos.In some respects, the authors\u2019 argument is optimistic. Political killing has declined because it has grown more taboo. As people become more educated, they expect better from their governments. As Singapore\u2019s former leader, Lee Kuan Yew, put it: \u201cOne simply cannot ask a highly educated workforce to stop thinking when it leaves the factory.\u201d That is why spin dictators try so hard to pretend to be democrats.Mr Guriev and Mr Treisman suggest a policy of \u201cadversarial engagement\u201d. The free world should watch more closely for signs that leaders\u2014including its own\u2014are grabbing unwarranted powers or undermining institutions. It should welcome modernisation even in dictatorships, since economic and social development may ultimately create more demands for liberty. It should stop helping dictators by laundering their money and reputations\u2014anonymous shell companies should be banned, and mischievous lawsuits against exiled dissidents should be curbed.Unfortunately, the arsenal of deceit is highly effective at keeping malign leaders in power, which is perhaps why global democracy has been in retreat for the past decade. And if those leaders remain in power for a long time, they often grow more repressive. Mr Putin may be less brutal than Stalin, but in his third decade in office he has shifted firmly from \u201cspin\u201d to \u201cfear\u201d. Xi Jinping, who also shows no sign of retiring, has turned China into a surveillance state. That is an aspect of 21st-century repression that this otherwise admirable book fails adequately to explore. In many countries people can neither trust their rulers, nor hide from them.

But at the end of March she had enough to last her only two or three weeks.Some help has been forthcoming. Governments have extended Russian tourist visas by a month in Thailand and three months in Sri Lanka. Many hoteliers are offering Russians steep discounts on room and board.

Yet they are finding that their dosh does not go as far as it used to. The value of the rouble plummeted by half in the weeks after the invasion (though it recovered sharply this week).

Unnecessary proteins, superfluous fluids and so on are carried away by special vessels to lymph nodes, where they are filtered out and destroyed. The more active the organ, the more of these vessels there are. The exception is the brain, which has none. It was thus thought until recently that brain cells broke down nearby waste products . organs waste matter is cleared out by the lymphatic system. Unnecessary proteins, superfluous fluids and so on are carried away by special vessels to lymph nodes, where they are filtered out and destroyed. The more active the organ, the more of these vessels there are. The exception is the brain, which has none. It was thus thought until recently that brain cells broke down nearby waste products .But a paper published in 2012 reported that the brain has a plumbing system of its own to flush out the junk. Researchers working in the laboratory of Maiken Nedergaard, at University of Rochester, in New York state, showed that cerebrospinal fluid\u2014the liquid which suspends the brain and acts as a cushion between it and the skull\u2014was actively washing through the organ by hitchhiking on the pulsing of arteries and veins that happens with every heartbeat. The fluid was collecting trash and carrying it out of the brain to lymph nodes for disposal. Now, ten years later, the discovery of this \u201cglymphatic\u201d system, so called because of the involvement of brain cells known as glia, has opened up new opportunities for the treatment of brain disorders.From the first studies of the glymphatic system, it was clear it might be involved in preventing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Alzheimer\u2019s is caused by a build-up of two types of proteins, amyloid-beta and tau. These aggregate to form plaques and tangles that stop neurons working properly and eventually lead to their death. When it is functioning normally, the glymphatic system clears out amyloid-beta and tau. However, in older people, or those with Alzheimer\u2019s, this process is slower\u2014leaving more potentially harmful proteins behind.Giving the brain a power wash, by improving the flow of glymphatic fluid, is a potential avenue for treatment. Though the field is in its infancy, most attempts to do so have focused on an interesting quirk of the system. This is that glymphatic fluid moves through the brain only during sleep. The plumbing is disabled during waking hours, and is most active during the deepest sleep stages, switched on by slow-wave brain activity.That discovery has changed how researchers think about the role of sleep, and also about the link between sleep and neurological disorders. For many diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s, a lack of sleep earlier in life increases the risk. Dr Nedergaard thinks that inadequate glymphatic clearance is the reason. Even a single night of sleep deprivation can increase the amount of amyloid-beta in the brain.Many drugs affect sleep, sometimes as a side-effect of their main purpose. A study published in  earlier this year followed almost 70,000 Danes who were being treated for high blood pressure, using beta-blockers. Some, but not all, types of beta-blockers are able to enter the brain by passing through the blood-brain barrier. This is a system of tight junctions between cells lining blood vessels in the brain, which exists to stop the admission of molecules that might upset the function of the organ. Once there, these beta blockers affect normal patterns of sleep and wakefulness. That, in turn, promotes glymphatic circulation. Those in the study who took barrier-crossing beta-blockers every day were less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s than people taking beta-blockers which could not enter the brain.Another medicine, suvorexant, which is used to treat insomnia, also shows promise. In one recent study, mice with a mutation that causes early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s in people, and similar symptoms in rodents, were given this drug. Mutated mice receiving suvorexant experienced less build up of amyloid-beta. Even more remarkably, the drug also reversed their cognitive decline. In a maze test, mutated mice on suvorexant performed as well as healthy, unmutated ones. A preliminary human trial of this effect is now under way.Sleep-promoting drugs can, however, have bad side-effects. Indeed, in many cases, including the Danish study, they increase the risk of death from other causes. Other people are therefore trying to boost glymphatic clearance by different means.One project, examining mice genetically engineered to be prone to Alzheimer\u2019s, found that increasing slow-waves during sleep, thus boosting fluid flow through the brain, reduced the amount of amyloid build up. This work involved \u201coptogenetics\u201d, in which cells are genetically engineered to respond to light, which is obviously a non-starter for a treatment for people. But a similar effect can be induced harmlessly in humans by non-invasive electrical stimulation.Some studies report that such stimulation can improve memory formation in the elderly. And it may also be relevant to the young and fit. America\u2019s Department of Defence is paying for at least two projects which have the goal of developing wearable caps to improve glymphatic flow during sleep in this way. Lack of sleep is a big problem in the armed forces. During combat, getting a solid eight hours can be hard, and lack of sleep inevitably affects a soldier\u2019s performance.As well as emphasising the importance of a good night's sleep, the discovery of the glymphatic system has highlighted other ways that a healthy life can promote a clean and tidy brain. In mice, exercise improves glymphatic flow, flushing out amyloid-beta. By contrast, high blood pressure, which prevents the normal pulsing of arteries and veins that drives the system, reduces fluid movement. In this context it is no surprise that hypertension during middle age increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease later on in life.The glymphatic system\u2019s discovery has had effects outside Alzheimer\u2019s research, too. Traumatic head injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease and mood disorders are all linked to glymphatic clearance. There is hope, as well, that this newly found plumbing may help with the delivery of brain drugs. Getting medicines past the blood-brain barrier is notoriously difficult. Injecting them into the cerebrospinal fluid directly, then allowing them to wash throughout the brain during sleep, may be simpler.Decades of Alzheimer\u2019s research has left behind a graveyard of failed drug trials. The brain\u2019s plumbing network is providing new targets, and new ways to think about treatments for the disease. The glymphatic system, then, is at last being tapped.

For unionists, it delineates Northern Ireland\u2019s distinct British identity. The two sides settled into an uneasy peace after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Then came Brexit, and an awkward fix in the form of the Northern Ireland protocol, designed to avoid inflaming the old dispute. Now some hope, and others fear, that it will strengthen the all-island economy and speed political reunification. The reality is more complicated\u2014and more fraught.Before the Brexit referendum, support was strong in Northern Ireland for the status quo. But the administration in Stormont created by the Good Friday deal failed to provide good government. It has collapsed repeatedly as one side or the other withdraws in a huff, leaving Northern Ireland to be governed from Westminster or administered by local civil servants. Politicians shy away from tough decisions, blaming Westminster for their problems while relying on it for hefty subsidies.Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union jolted this suboptimal equilibrium. Northern Ireland voted to remain, and its politicians were ill-prepared for the fallout. The United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the \u2019s customs union and single market meant new customs and regulatory barriers. Neither the  nor Britain\u2019s government wanted them on the island of Ireland, for fear that border infrastructure became a flashpoint. And so the protocol allowed goods to move freely between Northern Ireland and the Republic, instead imposing checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.The British government, however, has been slow to implement the barriers it had agreed to, not least because it denied there would be any. It has repeatedly delayed implementation, as well as showering traders with subsidies, for example by paying to issue health certificates for animal products going into Northern Ireland. On March 28th Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the protocol was \u201cnot sustainable\u201d in its current form. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has threatened to trigger Article 16, which would allow Britain to ditch parts of the deal\u2014and almost certainly bring retaliation from the .One consequence is that Northern Ireland\u2019s politics is becoming more fractious. In February Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (), the biggest of those supporting the link with Britain, vacated the position of first minister in protest at the Irish Sea border, thereby collapsing the power-sharing administration. At first the party had reluctantly accepted the protocol, but now says it will not return to government as long as the border remains.On the island of Ireland, unionists have always been a minority. That helps explain their insecurity and unease at anything that weakens Northern Ireland\u2019s ties with Britain and strengthens those with the Republic. In recent years the  has moved closer to the position of its fiercest critic within the unionist camp, Jim Allister, who left the  in 2007 to found the hardline Traditional Unionist Voice party. He regards the Irish Sea border as intended to redirect Northern Ireland\u2019s trade with the island of Britain towards the Republic, as the precursor to a united Ireland. Northern Ireland, he says, has moved into \u201ca waiting room for Irish unity\u201d.Others agree that the protocol brings unification closer\u2014but see that as welcome. Ever since the  forswore terrorism, its political wing, Sinn Fein, has pursued a two-pronged strategy: press for referendums on reunification on both sides of the border and in the meantime harmonise policy as much as possible, in order to make unity look less daunting.Before the referendum in 2016, Sinn Fein opposed Brexit, despite having long been staunchly anti-. After the vote, it backed the protocol because it would boost trade on the island of Ireland, says Chris Hazzard, one of its s: \u201cTrade, much like water running through the rocks, will find the path of least resistance.\u201d He, like many on his side in politics, thinks increased north-south trade will play a big role before any vote on unification, by strengthening cross-border connections and making Northern Ireland more prosperous.Old trade ties are indeed being broken and new ones forged. An official survey last October found that between a fifth and two-fifths of businesses sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are reducing quantities. Lloyd Jones runs a business from Northern Ireland supplying Amazon; he complains that English suppliers have been reluctant to send him dried dogfood because of uncertainty over paperwork. Mr Johnson once claimed he had an \u201coven-ready\u201d deal with the . \u201cFor me,\u201d says Mr Jones, \u201cthe chips are still stuck in the freezer.\u201dMeanwhile, some of Ireland\u2019s exporters seem to be capitalising on the disruption. Between 2016 and 2019 the share of Northern Ireland\u2019s export sales going to Great Britain fell from 60% to 48%, while the share going to the Republic rose by around six percentage points. Ireland\u2019s statistics show a 31% average annual increase in the value of trade with Northern Ireland between 2019 and 2021. Much of that predates the protocol, which came into force in January 2021. And some is trade in vaccines and plastics for covid-proofing offices. But Fergal O\u2019Brien of , a business association in the Republic, says that Brexit is driving some of the shift, as businesses \u201csee reshoring or sourcing from Northern Ireland as reduced supply-chain risk\u201d.Some economic activity has rerouted through Northern Ireland, as hauliers have shifted their operations to avoid the even tougher trade border between the Republic and Great Britain. Indeed, Northern Ireland\u2019s unique position, with privileged access to both the  and British markets, has fuelled talk of Brexit opportunities. Almac, a pharmaceutical company, boasts of the \u201cAlmac Advantage\u201d for just that reason. Official data published on February 24th suggested that Northern Ireland\u2019s economy had recovered more quickly than most other British regions from covid-19.That is encouraging, as far as it goes. But if economic integration were to precipitate political union in Ireland, says Sir Richard Evans of the University of Cambridge, it would be a historical exception rather than the rule. Despite a German customs union in the mid-1800s, members took opposing sides in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866; the first world war happened despite considerable European economic integration in the early 1900s. Newfoundland joined Canada because of economic distress rather than economic ties; similarly with Scotland signing the Act of Union that created the United Kingdom in 1707. Spain was unified by dynastic marriages; Italy by revolution and force.There are reasons to be sceptical that Northern Ireland will buck this long-run trend. One is that, in some ways, the island may not be integrating at all. The Northern Ireland protocol covered goods but not services, where there are now new barriers. Another relates to the hope that a more prosperous Northern Ireland would make voters in the Republic more eager for unification. But uncertainty about Northern Ireland\u2019s economic and political status is deterring the investment that might make that happen. And the best estimates available suggest that all these new barriers will, in fact, make Northern Ireland poorer.Although a long-standing arrangement between Ireland and Britain means citizens of either can live and work freely in the other, Brexit means that professional qualifications are no longer automatically recognised. And some positions in Ireland face stricter residency rules. For example, John Martin of the Road Haulage Association, an industry group, says these have meant haulage companies in Northern Ireland having to recruit extra transport managers in Ireland to manage their southern subsidiaries. A study published in March 2020 by Northern Ireland\u2019s Department for the Economy estimated that the impact of a bare-bones deal between Britain and the  for trade in services would be equivalent to significant tariff increases for exporters in Northern Ireland trying to serve the Republic\u2014from 4% to 9% for accounting services, for example, and from 5% to 14% for commercial banking.Both the British government\u2019s brinkmanship over the terms of the trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and political opposition to the protocol, make the business environment more uncertain. Last year rioting broke out in parts of Northern Ireland; in January a poll put unionist support for the protocol at just 2%. Officials carrying out border checks have received death threats. The  has briefed loyalist paramilitary groups, and in February loyalist anti-protocol protests resumed on the streets.If the protocol survives until December 2024, Northern Ireland\u2019s assembly is scheduled to decide then whether to keep it. Moreover, Irish unification would make the Irish Sea border harder still\u2014a point seemingly lost on those who argue that Northern Ireland\u2019s privileged position, with favoured market access to both Great Britain and the , will hasten reunification, which would end those privileges.As for prosperity, it is becoming clear that Northern Ireland\u2019s sweetheart deal merely softens the blow of Brexit, rather than averting it. The new way of doing things is more costly, says Peter Summerton of McCulla, a haulier: after all, were it not, it would already have become standard without Brexit. Previously, Northern Ireland\u2019s retailers were mostly stocked from distribution hubs in Great Britain. But he has recently opened a new hub for a major retailer in Mallusk, north of Belfast, which is supplying both Northern Ireland and Ireland with goods from the  and Great Britain. A team of 20 is required to handle the new paperwork. A survey in January 2022 from Manufacturing , an industry group, found that only 7% of its members saw Northern Ireland\u2019s status as an immediate opportunity, and only 18% saw it as a long-term one.According to Northern Ireland\u2019s statistical agency, two percentage points of Northern Ireland\u2019s 3% growth since 2019 was accounted for by the services sector, and 0.6 percentage points by the public sector. Production and construction each contributed 0.2 percentage points. That somewhat undermines the thesis that the economy boomed in 2021 because of superior access for goods going to the  and Britain. Economists at Strathclyde University have estimated that, relative to no Brexit, in the long term Northern Ireland\u2019s investment will be depressed by 3.3%, its  by 2.6% and real wages by 3.9%.That bodes ill for consent to unity in the Republic, where constitutional changes require a referendum, and where it is usual to set out proposals in great detail before any vote. Although unification has broad political support, once pollsters mention the price tag, respondents go cold.Analysis by the Institute for Government, a think-tank in London, suggests that in the 2018-19 fiscal year, Northern Ireland\u2019s public-sector deficit was 19% of its , or \u00a39.4bn ($12.4bn) more than its people paid in taxes\u2014and that is before the protocol was signed or any long-run effects of Brexit could become apparent. For the United Kingdom, that is 0.4% of ; for Ireland, it is 5%. \u201cIf you follow the German unification model and you re-rate everything then the burden becomes seven or eight per cent of national income,\u201d says John Fitzgerald of Trinity College Dublin.Cost is not the only reason citizens of the Republic might reject unification. They generally like the idea of more north-south trade, says Mary Murphy of University College Cork, but that sentiment is rather shallow. Unification would mean harmonising institutions, she points out, from the army and police to health and education systems. The Republic could not simply expect Northern Ireland to fall into line. Its population accounts for 3% of that of the United Kingdom, but would be 28% of a united Ireland. The most basic matters, such as whether the new state would be unitary or whether Northern Ireland would have some form of devolution from Dublin, have barely been discussed. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had this 800-year conflict with external forces on this island, you\u2019d think there\u2019d be a plan so persuasive that even Orangemen would give it a read,\u201d says Peter Shirlow of the University of Liverpool. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing there.\u201dNorth of the border, attitudes towards reunification are largely a matter of the heart, rather than the head. That is not so unusual internationally: Brexit showed that people do not always vote with their wallets; and Germany, that divided countries can be reunited despite great disparities and vast cost. For nationalists, uniting contentiously divided territory has a powerful patriotic allure. Unionists, too, identify strongly with their political position. Vernon Bogdanor, a constitutional expert at King\u2019s College London, remarks on the difference between the knowledgeable and positive representation of Northern Ireland\u2019s nationalists by the Irish government and even the , and how poorly understood unionists are in Westminster. That makes unionists think they have to be militant to be heard, he says.When Ireland was partitioned in 1921, the position of the border was chosen to create a Northern Ireland populous enough to be viable, but small enough to be dominated by Protestants, who were concentrated in the island\u2019s north-east. Census results due this autumn are expected to show that, a century later, Protestants are now outnumbered by Catholics. This worries many Protestants, yet both the old tribes are now minorities, with growing numbers of other faiths or none.A new and growing cohort of swing voters regard themselves as in neither camp, and many may be attracted to voting for unification because it would mean rejoining the . Moreover, to be Catholic no longer automatically equates to wanting unification\u2014or to wanting it immediately. Research by Mr Shirlow shows that support for the union is less siloed than is support for reunification: \u201cMore Catholics support the union than Protestants support unity.\u201dWhen the Good Friday Agreement was signed, a united Ireland looked like a matter for the distant future. The deal was vague on when a vote might happen, simply saying that the British government would call one if a majority in Northern Ireland looked likely to vote in favour. That moment has not arrived. A poll published in December found that a small majority of 54% wanted to remain part of the United Kingdom. (Other polls have found somewhat larger pro-union shares.) For their part, residents of mainland Britain seem not to care much one way or the other. A survey in April 2021 found that 46% would not be bothered if Northern Ireland left, and 11% would be pleased.That poll in December also found that 51% in Northern Ireland thought that a referendum in a decade\u2019s time would favour unification. Another the previous month had found that 60% in the Republic would vote for a united Ireland\u2014but also that support for unification fell to 41% when the cost was spelled out in the form of higher taxes. As long as support remains so shallow in the Republic, and so finely balanced in Northern Ireland, it is highly unlikely that any government, whether in Dublin, Stormont or Westminster, would consider calling a vote. If they did, however, an outcome that would have seemed inconceivable when the island was partitioned a century ago is no longer so: that Northern Ireland would say \u201cyes please\u201d, and the Republic would say \u201cno thanks\u201d.In one sense Brexit makes a united Ireland seem more likely than it used to, because it has unsettled previously apathetic voters. It has also made it harder, both by increasing the cost to the Republic and by providing a worked example of the difficulties of radical constitutional change. The post-2016 years have been divisive for British society, but there was never the slightest possibility that the losing side in the Brexit referendum would take up arms. In Northern Ireland it might, however, especially if a vote for reunification was close and contested. The Irish border has survived for a century for the same reason it was first drawn: an Ireland united and independent of Britain against the wishes of hundreds of thousands of unionists would probably result in civil war.

In the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, some $13bn each year is stolen through corruption, estimates the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in New York. That does not include tax evasion or forgone investment.In February , an investigative outlet based in El Salvador, published allegations that Alejandro Giammattei, Guatemala\u2019s president, received illicit funds during his presidential campaign in 2019. (He denies wrongdoing.) On February 15th Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, a former president of Honduras, was arrested on suspicion of aiding drug gangs. He will be extradited to the United States. Last year Mr Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s brother was sentenced to life imprisonment in New York for drug-trafficking.It is highly unlikely that either Mr Giammattei or Mr Hern\u00e1ndez will be charged in his home country. In 2019 Mr Giammattei\u2019s predecessor got rid of a -backed body which, for over a decade, had helped the attorney-general to investigate politicians and businessmen suspected of corruption, including two former presidents. Mr Hern\u00e1ndez and Nayib Bukele, El Salvador\u2019s president, have scrapped similar bodies in the past few years. (Xiomara Castro, the president of Honduras, wants the  to set up an anti-corruption unit.)Politicians and criminals constantly seek ways to influence the courts. Last year Mr Bukele forced all judges over the age of 60 or with more than 30 years of service to retire, rendering a third of posts vacant overnight. This allows him to stuff the judiciary with loyalists.

In 2019 its aspiration to become a member of the  was enshrined in its constitution. War has further fanned the flames of attraction, at least in one direction. Within a week of Russia invading on February 24th President Volodymyr Zelensky called for a shotgun wedding under a \u201cfast-track\u201d accession procedure. Europe, in full  mode, has made clear that there is no such thing and rules are rules. These stipulate that aspirant members must adopt decades-worth of  edicts on everything from how food is labelled to how banks are regulated. Even that only results in  membership for those countries the club has committed itself to. Ukraine is not among them.Europe needs to let go of the ablative absolutes and allow its romantic side to shine through. Yes, the  has rules and these matter: how else could a marriage of French officiousness and Germanic efficiency have endured for six decades? And indeed Ukraine is not going to meet the accession criteria for several years yet. Nobody thinks it should become the \u2019s 28th member immediately\u2014not even Mr Zelensky, probably. But Ukraine craves a commitment that, if it carries out the necessary reforms over the coming years, it will be allowed to become a member of the club. To this Europe should say: \u201cI will.\u201dSuch a decision is principally one for national governments, all 27 of which need to agree on matters relating to enlargement. Plenty want at least to give Ukraine a \u201cEuropean perspective\u201d, Euro-speak for starting the process of enlargement informally. The eastern European states would like for it to be officially considered a candidate for membership, a step further in the complex accession process. Reluctance from old-timers such as the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as lukewarm French support, mean the  thus far is only agreeing to \u201csupport Ukraine in pursuing its European path\u201d, which is diplomatic lingo for nothing. The European Commission has been asked to produce a report, a time-honoured stalling tactic.Ukraine\u2019s misfortune\u2014beyond sharing a border with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia\u2014is to have brought up the question of  membership at a time when enlargement fatigue reigns. No new member has been let in since Croatia in 2013. A handful of accession applications from the western Balkans are essentially frozen. That is in part because governments in countries from previous waves of accession, notably Poland and Hungary, have not lived up to their commitments on corruption and the rule of law. Diplomats from founding countries of the  mutter that they would be keener to divorce existing member states than tie the knot with new ones.Ukraine is different. Becoming an  member is a milestone for any country. But it would have special resonance in this case. Mr Putin, desperate to stop Ukraine from slipping out of Russia\u2019s sphere of influence, derailed the signing of that association agreement in 2013. The ensuing Maidan protests in Kyiv featured a sea of demonstrators waving  flags with more ardour than is ever seen inside the bloc. Dozens were shot and killed for it before a thuggish Kremlin-backed Ukrainian president fled to Russia. The  deal was ratified in 2014. By then, Russia had annexed Crimea and invaded eastern Ukraine, a prelude to the current war.Several arguments are made against giving Ukraine even informal assurances of future  membership. Emmanuel Macron of France says one could hardly open talks about accession with a country at war. That is beside the point, as what Ukraine really wants is a promise that once hostilities cease it can start jumping through the required hoops\u2014a process that took ten years for Croatia, and would take longer for a country needing reconstruction to boot. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, argues that immediate ways of helping Ukraine, such as supplying it with arms or imposing sanctions on Russia, matter more than long-term aspirations. Yet as Benjamin Tallis of the Hertie School in Berlin points out, the issue of  accession is important enough for Mr Zelensky, a man with rather a lot going on, to keep bringing it up.Some argue that any signal that Ukraine will one day join the  might provoke Russia. Into doing what that it is not already doing, exactly? Others say it would complicate peace talks. Again, Mr Zelensky probably knows best when it comes to Ukraine\u2019s national interest. Is there not a collective defence mechanism in the  that would tie existing member states to Ukraine? In truth that carries little weight. Bending the rules and giving Ukraine a status other countries have earned through years of reforms would ruffle Balkan feathers. That is true, but manageable.Much would need to go right for Ukraine to join the . It needs to fend off Russia, find a suitable peace then improve what until the war began had been a distinctly patchy record of reforms. If it pulls all of that off, letting a Europe-minded Ukraine into the club would not be a favour to Kyiv, as some stuffier member states seem to think, but a boon to the , too. As things stand European leaders are thinking with their heads, as bureaucrats are wont to do. But a union\u2014any union\u2014is a thing of the heart, too.

Petroleum products made up more than a quarter of the country\u2019s overall spending on imports last year\u2014more than for any other big economy. Could cheap Russian crude lower the bill?India has refrained from condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, even as the West has imposed sanctions. But big Russian banks have been cut off from the  messaging system used for cross-border transactions and American measures have largely blocked the use of dollars, complicating trade. Sergei Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister, was due to visit Delhi on March 31st, after we wrote this. One item on the agenda was expected to be finding ways to work around sanctions to enable Russian oil sales to India.Oil-and-gas firms in the two countries already work together.  Videsh, the Indian government\u2019s overseas oil-and-gas exploration and production arm, is involved in three projects in Russia, for instance; Rosneft, a Russian state-owned giant, owns 49% of Nayara Energy, a Mumbai-based firm with 6,000 filling stations and a large refinery in Gujarat.Yet overall oil trade between the countries is limited: according to India\u2019s government, less than 1% of its oil imports last year came from Russia. The fact that trade is a mere trickle is a reflection of geography rather than politics. India bought oil from Iran, another country that faced American sanctions, until about 2019. But Iran is separated from India only by a body of water. By contrast, there are neither direct overland routes nor short water crossings from Russia to India.In recent weeks a spate of reports in the Indian media have detailed new purchase agreements for Russian crude by Indian state-run oil companies. Hindustan Petroleum was said to have purchased 2m barrels and Indian Oil 3m barrels; Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals has sought to buy 1m. Others are said to have made bids for Russian oil, too.All told, the amount comes to perhaps 15m barrels, around three days of India\u2019s consumption. But this is seen as the first sign of closer engagement. Russia is said to have offered to pay transport and insurance costs, while offering steep discounts.The main difficulty, though, is payments. To deal with Iran after it came under sanctions in 2011, India used Uco Bank, a state-run firm with foreign operations that extended only to Singapore, Hong Kong and Tehran, and which was therefore outside the West\u2019s regulatory net. This time around, however, Singapore has cracked down on Russian transactions, meaning Uco cannot be used.India\u2019s government and central bank are therefore mulling other options. One idea that is reportedly being considered is using , Russia\u2019s alternative to , to conduct cross-border transactions, which would circumvent the dollar\u2019s financial plumbing. Another proposal, according to the  involves using the Indian operations of several large Russian banks as a conduit for transactions, by opening rupee accounts for Russian exporters.The problem, however, is that trade between the two countries is unbalanced: India imports more than twice as much from Russia as it exports, which would leave Russian sellers holding on to unwanted rupees. Plenty for Mr Lavrov and his hosts to chew over.

Oman was the essential middleman, providing an air-force jet to fly the prisoners to freedom and a bank to serve as a conduit for the British payment. British prisoners were freed from Iran in March, it was no surprise that Oman was their first stop. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori, held for years on bogus espionage charges, were freed as part of a deal that saw Britain settle an old debt with Iran. Oman was the essential middleman, providing an air-force jet to fly the prisoners to freedom and a bank to serve as a conduit for the British payment.Two years have passed since Sultan Haitham replaced his late cousin, Qaboos, who had ruled for five decades. Not much was known about him when he took over. Qaboos never publicly named a successor. It was unclear what to expect from the new man, whose hitherto humdrum career had consisted\u2014among other responsibilities\u2014of working in foreign affairs, cherishing the national heritage, watching football matches and running the census.Oman\u2019s role in the prisoner deal was a sign that, at least in foreign policy, the new boss is much like the old. Neighbouring Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates () are Gulf heavyweights with far deeper pockets and beefier armies. Instead Oman has used neutrality to its advantage, not just over Iran.The new sultan has kept Oman neutral in the war in neighbouring Yemen, which pits a Saudi-led coalition against the Houthis, a militant group that seized chunks of the country in 2014. He has set up talks between the warring parties, so far without much success, though in 2020 Oman negotiated a prisoner swap whereby the Houthis freed two Americans. Sultan Haitham is also friendlier with Saudi Arabia and the , hoping to woo investment. Mostly it has been business as usual.In domestic policy, though, he has broken with the past. Sultan Qaboos built the modern Omani state but did little to diversify its economy. Oman is a middling oil producer, pumping about 1m barrels a day, yet its economy depends utterly on the black stuff: petroleum accounts for two-thirds of exports and more than 70% of government revenue.Sultan Haitham inherited a sluggish economy.  growth had been below 2% since 2017. Years of low oil prices had driven Oman\u2019s external debt from 64% of  in 2016 to 94% in 2019. Then the pandemic hit, causing the non-oil economy to shrink by 4% in 2020 and pushing the current-account deficit to 14% of .This has spurred change, starting with the public sector. Oman\u2019s hefty public-wage bill was 15% of  in 2020 and 25% of spending. Yet stroll through the government quarter after 2pm and barely a civil servant is in sight. Since 2020 older ones have had to retire; new ones must earn lower wages. Last year Oman imposed a 5% value-added tax, the fourth Gulf state to do so. The finance ministry expects to collect 450m rials ($1.2bn) in 2022, 4% of revenue. Electricity and water tariffs rose last year. Subsidies may be phased out by 2025.This year\u2019s budget projects a 5% deficit, better than before but still high for a country with a debt-to- ratio above 100%. However, the budget was based on oil at $50 a barrel. So if prices stay at current levels, Oman should run a fat surplus and tip its current-account balance into the black. On March 24th the sultan pledged to use the windfall to pay down debt.The bigger challenge is how to diversify the economy and create jobs: half of young people are thought to be unemployed. Many of the big projects announced in the latter years of Qaboos\u2019s reign were still quite oily. Refineries and petrochemical plants are the star turns at Duqm, a mega-port on the Indian Ocean.The new sultan has avoided flashy mega-projects. He has reinstated the economy ministry, abolished in 2011, and created a new investment authority, both with mandates to create jobs. On March 28th the Muscat stock exchange said it would allow full foreign ownership of listed companies, hoping to drum up interest abroad.All of this should help. But the sultanate is still an amiably sleepy place. The shinier bits of Muscat, like the posh hotels and royal opera house by the beach in Qurm, have an almost Potemkin feel, as if they were built for tourists whom Oman barely bothered to woo. But the sultan\u2019s government recognises the need for change.

One of the five judges was Lord Reed, the head of Britain\u2019s supreme court.To anyone unfamiliar with Hong Kong\u2019s tangled history, this may seem odd. But judges from Britain\u2019s highest court have been doing double duty on Hong Kong\u2019s since 1997 as part of the deal that handed the city from Britain to China.This legacy of Hong Kong\u2019s past will not feature in its future, though. On March 30th Lord Reed and his colleague, Lord Hodge, resigned from Hong Kong\u2019s top court. No other serving British judge will be allowed to succeed them. According to Liz Truss, Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, a national-security law imposed on Hong Kong in 2020 has exerted a \u201cfar-reaching chilling effect\u201d. To stay on the top court \u201cwould risk legitimising oppression\u201d, she said.In commercial cases and ordinary criminal cases Hong Kong courts remain independent, says a British barrister who appears before them. But the national-security law has nonetheless had an \u201cinsidious effect\u201d. Ambitious judges \u201care not going to deliver rulings that displease Beijing\u201d. This is true even in cases that are not tried under the national-security law, but are politically charged.That puts the foreigners on the bench in a tricky position. Hong Kong welcomes judges from common-law jurisdictions\u2014and it has attracted some of the world\u2019s best. Such minds would improve any judiciary. The fact they could resign may also serve as a deterrent, preventing officials in Beijing from meddling more than they do. But by hanging around, foreign judges could also make it seem as if little has changed in Hong Kong. Their presence makes the courts better than they would otherwise be. It also makes them seem better than they actually are.Even now, some judicial links with Britain remain. Six retired British judges still serve on the top court; others appear elsewhere in the system. And because the legal system has English roots, cases still sometimes cite English precedents.

New polling from YouGov/ suggests that younger Americans are far more equivocal in their views on Russia and the war.Among some 1,500 people polled between March 19th and 22nd, 73% said they sympathise more with Ukraine than with Russia. Yet this disguises a big generational gap. Whereas 92% of those aged 65 and over said they sympathise more with Ukraine, just 56% of those aged 18-29 did\u2014a difference of 36 percentage points.Younger Americans are also less bothered about the war\u2019s outcome: barely half of those under 30 said they care who wins, compared with 90% of those over 65.

Younger people who said they were interested in politics were more sympathetic to Ukraine than their less-engaged peers. But the gap between well-informed older Americans and well-informed younger Americans is still wide, at 28 points, so that can be only part of the story.Perhaps the war seems distant to young Americans disillusioned by faraway conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

They hoped at least to send a message to China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, that the Ukraine war is a defining moment for relations, and for China\u2019s image if it refuses to use its influence to end the killing.In a sense Europe\u2019s representatives at the summit, Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, and Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, will be overshadowed by two figures who will not be there: Germany\u2019s former chancellor, Angela Merkel, and President Vladimir Putin of Russia. No leader is more closely associated with Europe\u2019s old China policy than Mrs Merkel. In 16 years as chancellor, she promoted an accommodating approach that treated China as an invaluable source of economic opportunity and a potential partner on such issues as climate change, albeit one prone to disappointing lapses on human rights.Mr Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine on February 24th was a disaster for advocates of this approach. For Russia\u2019s use of force has enjoyed Mr Xi\u2019s tacit support. Though China claims to be impartial, its true stance is anything but neutral. China blames the war on America, for supposedly trampling on Russia\u2019s legitimate security interests by expanding the  alliance to take in former Soviet satellite states. Europeans know that \u2019s expansion was actually driven by demand from former communist-bloc countries that feared Russian aggression (for good reason).  governments are horrified by China\u2019s refusal to urge Russia to stop the war. They see this foot-dragging as unworthy of a self-proclaimed global power, with a permanent seat on the  Security Council.It took Chinese diplomats a while to realise that European leaders would not agree to a conventional, trade-focused, summit. China\u2019s first offer was an online meeting with its prime minister, Li Keqiang, a technocrat with an essentially economic portfolio. China\u2019s preferred agenda involved the signing of memorandums, and talks about reviving the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (), a trade pact heavily backed by Mrs Merkel. That deal has been frozen since China imposed sweeping sanctions on members of the European Parliament and European diplomats in 2021. It was a lopsided retaliation against narrow  sanctions on three Chinese officials and one ex-official accused of rights abuses in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Several governments have told China that the  cannot return to life until the sanctions are lifted and concerns about forced labour in Xinjiang and other abuses are tackled.An early idea involved preceding the summit with a long-delayed high-level dialogue on human rights. China\u2019s price for resuming those dialogues was high, diplomats say. The  and members must stop supporting multinational, co-ordinated statements about Chinese rights abuses in such global forums as the  Human Rights Council, China demanded. That was rejected. Instead Mr Michel and Ms von der Leyen were due to raise human rights at the summit, touching on such thorny topics as China\u2019s iron-fisted rule over Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. The pair were also expected to raise Chinese threats towards Taiwan, the democratic island that China claims as its own.China\u2019s hope to mark the summit with a flurry of document signings were also dashed. That would involve progress on various customs and trade rules. And that cannot happen as long as an  member state, Lithuania, is being subjected to a Chinese trade boycott as punishment for forging quasi-official ties with Taiwan, other governments agree. Indeed, Mr Michel and Ms von der Leyen were expected to express the \u2019s horror over Chinese fondness for economic coercion.But first and foremost, the summit was seen as a chance to deliver messages about Ukraine. That involved seeking and securing a video call with Mr Xi, the ultimate decision-maker in matters of foreign policy. Pre-summit negotiations were tense. Europeans explained that Mr Xi would hear a warning: that China will face a serious cost if it helps Mr Putin circumvent Western sanctions on Russia, or provides military aid. Chinese officials pre-emptively instructed the Europeans not to threaten their leader.Europe is not used to talking war and peace with China. \u201cOur relations are based on trade and the economy, which makes us very opportunistic,\u201d says a European diplomat in Beijing. Arguably, China is doing Europe a favour by explaining how it expects the West to be a loser from the conflict in Ukraine. Chinese officials boast to ambassadors in Beijing that they see the  dividing between old and newer members. Those Chinese also predict that transatlantic unity between Europe and America will crumble and that sanctions will fail to break Russia\u2019s will, not least as European voters protest against high energy prices and flows of refugees from Ukraine.Chinese glee about Western disunity is useful: proving it wrong is a good starting point for an  strategy towards China. As a second diplomat puts it: \u201cChina is watching our Russia policy closely: how much pain we are willing to suffer. Europe is demonstrating that it is united and willing to pay a price.\u201d The stakes are high, he adds. Deterring a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan requires demonstrating that the West is capable of unity and resolve.Other voices urge calm. China needs Europe as a market, and as a source of technology and investments, they note, especially when China\u2019s ties with America are in dire shape. Some of Europe\u2019s largest companies have lucrative China operations which they are not about to abandon. According to diplomats, there is no sign of China circumventing sanctions on Russia. But Mr Putin is trying to redraw Europe\u2019s borders by force, and Mr Xi will not condemn him. That is a direct challenge to the s founding principles. It cannot be business as usual.

In October your correspondent boarded a train from Nigeria\u2019s capital, Abuja, to the northern city of Kaduna. A fault held up its departure for 30 minutes. This was just long enough that a train coming in the opposite direction was the first to trigger explosives placed on the track. Luckily, in that attack, the train limped on and nobody was hurt.Passengers travelling on the same line on March 28th were less fortunate. First a bomb derailed their train. Then gunmen set upon the estimated 400 passengers and guards, killing eight, injuring 25 and kidnapping an unknown number. The attack was the most brazen yet by the kidnapping gangs locally known as bandits that terrorise the region. This lawlessness, in addition to a long-running insurgency in the north-east by jihadists affiliated with Islamic State and regular clashes between farmers and herders, are rendering large parts of Africa\u2019s most populous country ungovernable.The 190km road between Abuja and Kaduna has long been a favourite hunting ground for the gangs, which regularly ambush travellers and herd them into forest hideouts where they hold them for ransom. In recent years thousands have been abducted, with relatives paying billions of naira (there are 415 naira to $1) for their return. Many hoped that trains, which started running in 2016, would be a safer alternative. But as well-heeled Nigerians switched from road to rail, so the gangs have begun targeting trains.\u201cWe warned that lives will be lost,\u201d fumed Rotimi Amaechi, the transport minister, after the attack, accusing his colleagues of blocking funds for cameras and sensors that might have averted it. \u201cNow lives are lost.\u201dTwo days before the train outrage, gunmen attacked Kaduna airport, killing an employee and further isolating the city.

From the beach it is impossible to tell that a huge desalination plant not half a mile away is sucking in seawater to produce 50m gallons of new drinking water each day. It is the largest in America\u2014for now. Soon it may share that title with a proposed sister plant 60 miles (97km) north in Huntington Beach. But only if that one is built.Poseidon Water, the developer that also built the Carlsbad plant, first proposed the Huntington Beach facility in the 1990s. But it has taken the company more than two decades to persuade Californians of the plant\u2019s necessity. Many Orange County residents remain unconvinced or even hostile to the idea. Now the firm is waiting for a final permit from the California Coastal Commission. Without it, Poseidon says the project is dead in the water.The fight in Huntington Beach has sparked a wider debate over what role desalination should play in preparing California for a drier future. A recent study found that the current drought is the driest 22-year period the south-west has seen in at least 1,200 years. Climate change has diminished snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains, shrivelling the rivers which feed California\u2019s reservoirs. The state recently told farms and cities they would receive only 5% of their normal allocation from the State Water Project, a series of dams, canals and pipelines. Might desalination help make up the difference?The arguments against desalination are well known. Environmentalists fret that the plants\u2019 intake systems and the salty brine they discharge back into the ocean harm marine life. The reverse-osmosis process used to separate the salt from the water is energy-intensive. And desalination is the most expensive option among alternative water sources. An analysis from the Pacific Institute, a think-tank in Oakland, estimates that the median cost for a big seawater-desalination project is $2,100 per acre-foot of water (an acre-foot is about 1,230 cubic metres). Large water-recycling projects, the next-priciest option, cost roughly $1,800 an acre-foot.To understand the costs and benefits of desalination in practice, look to San Diego. Investing in desalination seemed prescient when the San Diego County Water Authority (), which supplies water to 3.3m southern Californians, began planning the Carlsbad plant in 1998, for two main reasons. First, when rivers run low, much of California can tap underground aquifers for drinking water and agriculture. But the far south-western corner of California does not have a large ground water basin, meaning the region long relied on water imported from elsewhere.Second, a severe drought starting in the late 1980s cut the county\u2019s water supply by 31%, says Sandra Kerl, \u2019s general manager. Those cuts (and an acrimonious relationship with water officials in Los Angeles, who controlled local supplies) scared local managers into exploring alternative water sources, such as desalination, to prevent rationing in future. Today, 10% of the county\u2019s water comes from the Carlsbad plant and San Diegans can breathe easier in times of drought.Now consider the costs. Over the past decade water prices have risen faster in San Diego than in Los Angeles. Kelley Gage, \u2019s director of water resources, argues that rates will climb across the state as other cities invest in recycling or shoring up leaky infrastructure. Desalinated water is also used inefficiently. Pristine water from the Carlsbad plant enters a centralised plumbing system just like treated water from the Colorado River, for example. \u201cUtilities have to think about the fact that this water is too good to be flushed down toilets and used for watering lawns,\u201d says Newsha Ajami, a water expert at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.As San Diego was scrambling to diversify its water supply, demand was decreasing. Thanks to conservation efforts, per-person water use in California\u2019s big cities has declined since 2000 even as populations have soared. Some San Diegans wonder if their expensive plant was necessary.Desalination makes more sense in some parts of California than others. The Golden State\u2019s water wonks point to the central coast, which often suffers from drought. Adrian Covert, vice-president of public policy at the Bay Area Council, a business association, suggests Marin County should also consider desalination. A wealthy county just north of San Francisco, Marin has the need\u2014it is dependent on local rainfall\u2014and the cash to invest.Water-policy nerds favour desalination as a last resort, preferring conservation, recycling and capturing stormwater. \u201cIt\u2019s all about lawns and leaks,\u201d says Felicia Marcus, a former chair of the California State Water Resources Control Board. Yet most experts agree that desalination could play a larger role in the state\u2019s water mix as technology improves. \u201cDesalination is ripe for innovation,\u201d says Peter Fiske, also of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Researchers are studying how to make plants more flexible through automation, whether the brine discharged back into the ocean can be used for something, and the economics of desalting water using solar power.California is not the only state mulling desalination. Doug Ducey, Arizona\u2019s Republican governor, wants to invest $1bn in the technology. The Biden administration has allocated $250m in funds from the bipartisan infrastructure law for desalination projects (a proverbial drop in the bucket). If and when desalination does take off, Ms Marcus warns that technology alone cannot \u201cdrought-proof\u201d the state: \u201cThe idea that you can somehow build enough facilities to support urban California through desal is a pipe dream.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-desalination/21808460", "date_modified": "2022-03-31T14:41:54Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/03/articles/main/20220402_usp001.jpg"},
{"title": "The case for managerial decency", "content": "MANAGEMENT ENTAILS some unpleasant conversations, none worse than telling employees that they have lost their jobs. There is nothing enjoyable about giving people this kind of news. But it can be done well or it can be done badly\u2014or it can be done in the style of Peter Hebblethwaite. some unpleasant conversations, none worse than telling employees that they have lost their jobs. There is nothing enjoyable about giving people this kind of news. But it can be done well or it can be done badly\u2014or it can be done in the style of Peter Hebblethwaite.Mr Hebblethwaite is the chief executive of & Ferries, a ferry operator that carries passengers and freight between Britain and continental Europe. On March 17th the company told almost 800 of its workers on a video call that they were being replaced with immediate effect by cheaper foreign contractors. Security guards were on hand to escort the dismissed workers from the ships.On March 24th Mr Hebblethwaite was hauled in front of a committee of British s to explain himself. \u201cAre you in this mess because you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing, or are you just a shameless criminal?\u201d was the first question. And that was before he made them really angry. He admitted he had not seen a safety-risk assessment into the implications of replacing the original crews with agency workers (two of the affected vessels have subsequently been held in port because of safety concerns). He openly acknowledged that the firm had broken the law by not consulting on the dismissals with trade unions, but that he would make the same decision again because the unions would never have agreed to the plans.If you want to know what slack-jawed astonishment looks like, watch someone telling legislators that the law is not worth following. But what if you take Mr Hebblethwaite at his word\u2014that the business was unsustainable and that the firm faced a choice between cutting some jobs immediately and losing them all? This is a kind of managerial \u201ctrolleyology\u201d, the name given to a set of moral thought experiments involving a runaway railway carriage that is careering towards a group of people. In these experiments participants are asked whether they would intervene and sacrifice someone else in order to save the lives of others. Dismissing workers in order to save more jobs is the workplace version of this problem.The Hebblethwaite approach to managerial trolleyology is a simple matter of accounting: saving 3,000 jobs is worth the loss of 800 workers. That meant moving fast, and not bothering with niceties like following the law or affording people due process or dignity.But the point of trolleyology is that the brute logic of numbers often conflicts with moral intuitions. Ethical considerations can involve nuances of behaviour, not just outcomes. For example, people are much more willing to switch train tracks so the runaway carriage collides with someone else than they are to push someone off a bridge into the path of the train in order to slow it down.In managerial trolleyology, too, behaviour matters\u2014even to staunch utilitarians. It makes a difference how people are treated when they lose their jobs, and not just to those who are out of work. Callousness affects the morale of those who are left behind: recent research suggests that a toxic corporate culture is more likely to lead to employee attrition than any other factor. How firms handle redundancies also sends signals to prospective employees, customers and investors. Airbnb chose to publish the memo that Brian Chesky, its boss, sent to employees in May 2020, in which he used a blend of compassion and commercial logic to explain his decision to cut 25% of the workforce.Displays of humanity can be good for the share price. A new study, from academics at the University of Zurich, the London School of Economics and Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge, looks at how chief executives responded to the outbreak of covid-19 in early 2020. The authors review transcripts of investor calls in which bosses discussed the pandemic, and find that whereas virtually all of them referred to its economic impact, only about half of them mentioned the human costs. The share prices of firms run by the more compassionate-sounding bigwigs outperformed the others in the early stages of the crisis and well beyond.Every situation is different. The & debacle reflects specific aspects of maritime employment law, for example. But if you want a steer on how to handle mass redundancies, Mr Hebblethwaite does not provide it. Managers routinely have to make tough decisions about letting workers go.

People scrambled to buy supplies. Vegetables became scarce. Some bankers began sleeping in their offices.The lockdown is in line with China\u2019s \u201czero-covid\u201d strategy, which aims to crush outbreaks before they can spread widely. Thousands of new cases of the highly transmissible Omicron variant are testing this approach. The wave has hit most provinces. Restrictions have been imposed on dozens of cities and towns. The experience of Hong Kong is causing Chinese officials to be extra-vigilant. Not long ago the city had very few cases. Now it has one of the highest daily death rates from the virus. The vast majority of the dead are unvaccinated old people. Around 65% of over-80s in Hong Kong had not been jabbed when the Omicron wave started.The mainland has a similar problem. Unlike other countries, which made jabbing the elderly and other vulnerable people a priority, China focused on its overall vaccination rate. It stands at nearly 88%. But only about half of over-80s have been fully vaccinated (see chart). Less than a fifth have received a booster shot. Some 52m people over the age of 60 have not received two jabs. In official statements, the government sounds alarmed. Its efforts to jab mature folk face big obstacles, though.Start with the fact that many old people think covid vaccines might be dangerous. When they were rolled out in late 2020, the state only approved shots for healthy people under 60. It cited a lack of clinical-trial data for elderly and vulnerable populations. Many old people assumed that the vaccines could harm them. Some health workers did, too. \u201cThe first impression is really critical,\u201d says Chen Zhengming, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford. \u201cOnce you have formed your opinion it\u2019s really difficult to change, it requires ten times more effort.\u201dSince then, the messaging surrounding covid vaccines has not helped. Jingoistic state media have criticised effective foreign-made jabs, which have not been authorised in China for seemingly political reasons. This has probably increased suspicion of Chinese vaccines, too, says Huang Yanzhong of the Council on Foreign Relations, a think-tank in America. Even though the Chinese kind have now been declared safe for old folk, some health workers still tell elderly patients with certain conditions, such as high blood pressure, not to get jabbed. That makes little sense, says Mr Huang. \u201cEven if you\u2019re concerned about side effects, when you weigh that against the risk of getting infected and dying, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201dBut the risk of getting infected with covid and dying is, for now, very low in China\u2014and that makes the government\u2019s job tougher. At least until recently, the state\u2019s zero-covid policies have been effective. Many cities have never logged a case. Most old people have hardly been exposed to the virus, and have little fear of it as a result.Local governments are trying a range of strategies to get old people vaccinated. In the eastern city of Nantong, officials are leaning on younger people, appealing to their sense of filial duty. Get your parents vaccinated so they can become the \u201csilver-haired guardians\u201d of their own health, say the authorities. A city in the province of Hainan has put out a less lofty appeal: get vaccinated and receive a dead chicken. Officials in other towns are offering cooking oil, eggs or cash in return for getting a jab.In a park in Beijing, two green tents were recently set up for vaccinating old folk. Signs promised 200 yuan ($31) for those receiving their first dose. When your correspondent visited, half a dozen people were sitting in one tent. They had just been jabbed and were waiting to see if there were any side effects. Even with a steady flow of patients, it will take months for China to vaccinate and boost its elderly population. And some will remain unwilling. Outside the tent, in a wheelchair, was a woman in her 80s. Would she get the shot? \u201cNot interested,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does no good.

Within hours, they were at home in tears\u2014and not because of playground fights or test results. In a last-minute pivot, the Taliban had backtracked on a decision to reopen secondary schools for girls and sent them home.The new Taliban are beginning to look a lot like the old Taliban who ran Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, when women who failed to cover every inch of flesh in public were beaten and adulterers were stoned to death. But Afghan women have changed after two decades of American-backed government. Many have university degrees. Before the Taliban seized power last year, almost 30% of civil servants were women. On the streets of Kabul book-waving girls have been chanting: \u201copen the schools\u201d.When American forces withdrew from Afghanistan, the big question was how the Taliban would make the transition from a fundamentalist insurgency to running a country. Girls\u2019 education became the litmus test. In August there was some hope they wanted to show a gentler face. Officials were interviewed by female presenters on television. At the Taliban\u2019s first press conference after seizing power, a spokesman reassured the world that women would be \u201cvery active\u201d in Afghan society.That balancing act seems over. The abrupt -turn on education, which affects over 1m school-age girls, is one of a string of recent repressive edicts. New rules ban women from travelling long distances without a male chaperone. That can mean they need a brother or a husband to enter a government building or a taxi. A surgeon in Kabul says Taliban officials often visit, warning him not to see female patients who turn up alone. \u201cThis is a sad moment for all of us,\u201d he adds.Years of progress are imperilled. Under the previous democratic government, backed by American troops and money, there was corruption and bigotry. But the female literacy rate more than doubled between 2000 and 2018 to 30%. Thousands of women got jobs as doctors, lawyers or cops. Some became entrepreneurs. Maternal mortality declined sharply and female life expectancy rose by ten years.Now a generation of girls is falling behind. Some risk their lives to attend underground schools. Sexist violence was a problem even before the Taliban takeover, with 87% of women and girls saying they had suffered abuse. Many teenagers will become mothers before schools reopen.Life is no better for older women who managed to get an education before last year\u2019s takeover. The Taliban have purged women from most workplaces. In a  survey conducted in October, every single person interviewed knew a woman who had lost her job in the previous month. Qamarulbanat Quraishy has been unemployed since August and is frantically searching for work. But employers are turning away female candidates. Ms Quraishy\u2019s savings have run dry and her debts are mounting. \u201cI have no hope,\u201d says the 24-year-old.Bigotry affects the economy too. In terms of the increase in hourly earnings from an extra year of schooling, the return on educating girls in Afghanistan was more than double that of educating boys. The children of educated mothers have long been better educated, healthier and likely to earn more later in life. The  reckons that keeping women out of work costs Afghanistan up to $1bn, or 5% of .In the midst of an economic crisis, the country can ill afford the loss. When the Taliban took over, sanctions stemmed the flow of money. Foreign aid, which made up three-quarters of the state budget, dried up. Ordinary Afghans cannot withdraw savings from local banks. Many have been unpaid for months. Almost the entire population could be desperately poor by the middle of the year.The chaotic way in which decisions have been announced points to a split between hardliners and pragmatists within the Taliban. Secondary schools received orders not to admit girls only after they had arrived on campus last week. Taliban leaders have been ambiguous about this policy. In some provinces, such as Kunduz and Balkh in the north of the country, girls were allowed to return to school not long after the Taliban takeover. A handful of high-ranking officials continue to educate their daughters overseas.As Ashley Jackson at the Overseas Development Institute, a think-tank in London, puts it, \u201ccompeting visions\u201d within the Taliban are playing out in public. The only hope is that decisions that shut women out of public life could be reversed as quickly as they were announced.

For most of his life he shared a room with his brother; his sister slept in her parents\u2019 bed until she was 13. Leak stains still blotch the walls. Bars on the windows keep out thieves and most sunshine. \u201cThis is the raw side of Chile,\u201d he says.But Mr Marambio, who is now 30, defied the odds. He was the first in his family to go to university. His parents worked day and night to pay for some of his expenses, and he owes around $20,000 in student loans. Education was his ladder out of poverty. After working for the local mayor and then for a polling firm, he moved to a nicer part of town and bought his parents a house. On a visit to La Pintana a former neighbour greets him: \u201cMy boy, you\u2019ve come back to visit the poor!\u201dHis story reflects the success of Chile\u2019s education system. Since the country returned to democracy in 1990, the number of students enrolled in post-secondary institutions has quintupled (see chart). By the mid 2000s seven in ten newly enrolled students were from the first generation of their families to attend university. Unsurprisingly, this expansion has cost money. Fully 59% of spending on tertiary education comes from households, compared with an average of 30% across the , a club mostly of rich countries. Tuition fees in Chile are the highest in the  relative to purchasing power after Britain and the United States (but, as in both countries, financial support is hefty).Yet discontent with education has led to some of the biggest protests in Chile\u2019s history. In 2006 children demonstrated against perceived inequality in schooling; in 2011 university students did the same. Large, violent protests in 2019 were partly about college fees. It was as a student leader that Gabriel Boric, the newly elected 36-year-old president, rose to fame, along with many in his cabinet. \u201cThe fight for public, free and good-quality education was a fight for a different model of society,\u201d he told a crowd in November. As president, he says he wants to reform education. But in its zeal for change, his government could make Chile\u2019s problems worse.Chile\u2019s school system has long been unusual. Under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who ruled from 1973 to 1990, the country widened the use of standardised tests and set up a voucher scheme which provided public funds to privately run schools based on the number of children that enrolled. The idea was to increase competition and choice. Most parents chose voucher schools. Between 1981 and 2020 the share of children in voucher schools shot up from 15% to 54%. The share in government-run schools fell from 78% to 33%; the share in expensive private schools that did not take vouchers remained around 10%.Some analysts credit the system for improving results. Chile scores the highest in Latin America on a test conducted by the  on the science, maths and reading skills of 15-year-olds around the world. Yet others fear that the voucher schools increased the gulf between rich and poor. Until 2016, when Michelle Bachelet, a former left-wing president, introduced a series of reforms, these schools often selected students using their own criteria, such as primary-school grades or whether parents were married in the Catholic church. They could also charge top-up fees.A study from 2016 by Gregory Elacqua and Humberto Santos, two academics in Chile, compared the degree to which rich and poor kids were educated separately under the voucher system in Santiago with what would have occurred if students had attended the school nearest their homes. They concluded that schools were more segregated than neighbourhoods. This contradicts the claim that voucher schools simply reflect the societies they serve.Richer Chileans also do better at university. In order to get into one, students must take an admissions test similar to the  in the United States. More than half of those who achieve top scores come from the 10% who go to elite (ie, non-voucher) private schools. Students who do not score well largely end up in less prestigious technical institutes. This means that many poorer students finish higher education with big debts and degrees that employers do not value much. Fully 54% of students who have taken out the main student loan have defaulted or are in arrears, compared with 32% of student debtors in America.Successive presidents have tinkered with the system. Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, the centre-right president during the protests in 2011, lowered the interest rate on the main student loan from 6% to 2%. In 2016 Ms Bachelet made university free for the poorest 60% of students. This bung to students was popular, even if the reform meant that there was probably less public money than there might have been for primary and secondary education. Between 2012 and 2018 public spending on tertiary education increased more in Chile than in any other  country, while public spending on non-tertiary education increased only somewhat faster than the  average.Mr Boric has promised to improve state-run primary and secondary schools, but has so far provided few details. He has pledged to continue some of Ms Bachelet\u2019s reforms, alongside increasing funding for public nurseries. However, he also wants to remove \u201cmarket dynamics\u201d in education, meaning competition.

To understand their worldview better, it can be illuminating to ask them whom they admire. politicians make often sound similar: more jobs, more roads, few details. To understand their worldview better, it can be illuminating to ask them whom they admire.William Ruto, Kenya\u2019s deputy president and a marginal favourite to win a presidential election in August, tells  that he is inspired by Julius Nyerere, the first president of Tanzania, and Margaret Thatcher. It is an odd combination. One destroyed Tanzania\u2019s economy by nationalising businesses and forcing people into collective farms. The other transformed Britain\u2019s economy through privatisation.In Tanzania, Mr Ruto explains, Nyerere built \u201csomething that we are struggling to build\u201d: a national identity that overcame tribal differences. Kenyan politics, by contrast, have long been tribal and sometimes violent. During the 1990s the Kalenjin (those who speak a clutch of languages in the Rift Valley) killed hundreds of Kikuyu (Kenya\u2019s largest tribe) to tilt the local electoral balance. Ethnic slaughter erupted again after a disputed election in 2007. More than 1,000 people died.Mr Ruto, a Kalenjin who says he is building a national party, not a tribal one, may also be invoking Nyerere the uniter because of his own reputation as a divider. In 2013 the International Criminal Court accused him of orchestrating the violence in 2007. The case against him was never proved. The court suspended the charges (which he denies) after prosecution witnesses recanted or disappeared.Thatcher is admired, he says, because she came from a humble background. Mr Ruto, who once sold fried chicken to motorists at a railway crossing, argues he is a \u201chustler\u201d like the poor whose votes he is courting. He dismisses as \u201cdynasts\u201d his main opponent, Raila Odinga, a son of Kenya\u2019s first vice-president, and Mr Odinga\u2019s main backer, the incumbent, Uhuru Kenyatta, a son of Kenya\u2019s first president.Mr Ruto does, indeed, offer at least a few echoes of the Iron Lady in his economic policies. He wants to encourage the growth of small businesses by cutting red tape. But Mrs T would probably have sniffed at much of his \u201cbottom-up economics\u201d plan, which would subsidise fertilisers and cap interest rates.If Mr Ruto\u2019s economic policies seem contradictory, they are not uniquely so. Mr Odinga tells  that he takes inspiration from Lee Kuan Yew, who oversaw Singapore\u2019s astonishing economic success. The late Lee is a popular role model among African leaders, many of whom admire his tough style and achievements. Yet few have emulated Lee\u2019s personal discipline, willingness to curb corruption or commitment to opening the economy. Another of Mr Odinga\u2019s idols is Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India. Mr Odinga is impressed by how Mr Modi attracted investment and spurred economic growth, (though, one would hope, not by Mr Modi\u2019s religious chauvinism).Mr Odinga says he, too, wants to boost growth and attract investment. Yet he is going about it in an odd way. Like Mr Ruto, he punts \u201cbottom-up economics\u201d and subsidised fertiliser. He also wants to renegotiate Kenya\u2019s debt (which is about 70% of  with its external creditors. When asked what are the main differences between his platform and Mr Ruto\u2019s, he suggests personalities, rather than policies. \u201cI stand for righteousness\u2026and against corruption,\u201d Mr Odinga says. \u201cMy opponent is basically the opposite of me.\u201dThat both campaigns are so light on policy is perhaps a reflection of the deep cynicism pervading Kenyan politics. Mr Odinga, who is making his fifth bid for president, claims to have been cheated of victory in Kenya\u2019s three most recent elections, starting with 2007, when Mr Ruto was then his loyal chief lieutenant. In 2017 he claimed an electoral official had been murdered to facilitate a rigging of the count that handed victory to Mr Kenyatta.Yet since Mr Odinga forged an alliance with President Kenyatta in 2018, he no longer asks questions about the murdered official. Nor has he sought justice for the scores of his supporters who were shot dead by the police after he called for protests against the outcome of the election.This cynicism seems to percolate down to the electorate, too. When in February Mr Kenyatta endorsed Mr Odinga, once his bitter est rival, and denounced Mr Ruto, his deputy for the past ten years, Kenyans barely turned a hair. \u201cPolitics in Kenya is like looking through a kaleidoscope,\u201d grumbles a Western diplomat. \u201cThe bits are still the same but every time you shake it they form different patterns.\u201dOne reason for it may be that electoral contests are not ideological sparring grounds. Instead many voters still cast their ballots on ethnic lines. Few political parties survive more than one electoral cycle. \u201cPolitical parties are single-purpose vehicles,\u201d designed solely to catapult their leaders to power, says David Ndii, an economic adviser to Mr Ruto. Mr Odinga has belonged to six political parties, Mr Ruto to five and President Kenyatta to four. As a result, there is usually little to distinguish presidential candidates from each other.The unpalatable choice before Kenyans may explain why this election is likely to be characterised by indifference. Apathy is preferable to violence, but it is still corrosive and leads to stagnation. The Kenya African National Union () was once the country\u2019s only legally permitted political party, ruling from 1963 until 2002.In every single election since then the winners and runners-up, as well as all their key lieutenants, have been former card-carrying members of . No new political party has been able to break through. Kenya has many parties on paper. Yet it still bears the imprint of its corrupt old one-party system.

The disease had by then been gathering momentum for a couple of hundred years, and despite the advent of the first effective tool for stopping it in its tracks\u2014inoculation\u2014it embarked on a spree of regicide, diverting more than one royal house\u2019s line of succession.By Lucy Ward.  dramatic showdown between humans and smallpox probably took place in Europe in the 18th century. The disease had by then been gathering momentum for a couple of hundred years, and despite the advent of the first effective tool for stopping it in its tracks\u2014inoculation\u2014it embarked on a spree of regicide, diverting more than one royal house\u2019s line of succession.So recounted Donald Hopkins in his encyclopedic history of the disease, \u201cPrinces and Peasants\u201d, published in 1983. Now Lucy Ward has zoomed in on one of the more dramatic episodes in that dramatic century, blowing it up to book length. Whether it merits retelling in such detail is debatable, but Catherine the Great of Russia\u2019s decision to get both herself and her son inoculated certainly resonates in these contagious times. It marked a watershed in popular acceptance of the prophylactic technique and showed the power of leadership by example. Irresponsible rulers of the covid-19 era could take a leaf out of the empress\u2019s book.Born in Prussia, Catherine was on a drive to modernise her adopted country, and as the first reigning European monarch to volunteer herself\u2014as well as her offspring\u2014for inoculation, she was taking a brave step and a calculated risk. The procedure involved smearing pus from an infected person\u2019s blisters into small incisions in a healthy person\u2019s skin. It was far safer than catching the disease naturally, but not as safe as vaccination, which would develop out of the inoculation method and used the related but milder cowpox virus to confer protection.Smallpox at that time was often lethal. When it did not kill, it could blind or disfigure. So when, in 1768, the English doctor Thomas Dimsdale was summoned to St Petersburg to do the honours, he had understandable qualms about the assignment. Catherine assured him that a yacht would be standing by in the Gulf of Finland, ready to whisk him out of Russia should anything go wrong.Nothing did go wrong, and once the clandestine procedure was deemed a success, news of it was broadcast from the onion-domed rooftops. There were fireworks and religious blessings, poems and plays were penned, a national holiday was declared. Voltaire wrote to Catherine, his longtime correspondent, lamenting the French ban on the technique: \u201cYou have been inoculated with less fuss than a nun taking an enema.\u201dMs Ward\u2019s vivid and well-told story raises the interesting question of who deserves credit for inoculation. The aristocratic Mary Wortley Montagu had brought it back to England earlier in the century, having seen elderly Turkish women perform it on her travels. English medics then modified it\u2014making it more rather than less dangerous.But an enterprising layman, Daniel Sutton, stripped away the modifications to produce the method that Dimsdale publicised and carried to Russia. (Dimsdale\u2019s genteel manners and scientific standing made him a better emissary than the less polished, more commercially minded Sutton.) In the absence of sufficient numbers of doctors to roll it out in Russia, after inoculation caught on, peasant women were deputised to help once again\u2014only now to perform a technique that had the stamp of scientific approval.As so often, many people contributed to the success of the invention. But successful it indubitably was. In the last hundred years of its existence, smallpox is estimated to have killed half a billion people; but in Russia, Catherine\u2019s gesture made inoculation fashionable and later led to the rapid adoption of vaccination. In this way she helped set the world on the path to the eradication of the scourge. That milestone was announced in 1980, just over two centuries after she, her son and their doctor risked their lives to demonstrate that disease need not be destiny.

{"title": "How tanks can survive against cheap, shoulder-fired missiles", "content": "RUSSIAN TANKS have been having a torrid time during the invasion of Ukraine. According to Oryx, an open-source intelligence blog, at least 153 of them have been destroyed so far, along with 312 armoured vehicles. (The figures for the Ukrainian side are 26 and 57 respectively.) have been having a torrid time during the invasion of Ukraine. According to Oryx, an open-source intelligence blog, at least 153 of them have been destroyed so far, along with 312 armoured vehicles. (The figures for the Ukrainian side are 26 and 57 respectively.)Many of these have been blown up by cheap anti-tank guided missiles (s) . Western countries have shipped thousands of such weapons to Ukraine, ranging from  via Swedish-designed s to German-made Panzerfaust-3s. The war has been a powerful demonstration of the threat they pose to modern armour, says Jon Hawkes, a land-warfare guru at Jane\u2019s, a British military intelligence firm. Some Russian tank drivers have resorted to welding  to their vehicles in a dubious effort to add extra protection.It is ironic that s have proved so effective, since Russia\u2014and the Soviet Union before it\u2014was a pioneer of so-called \u201cactive protection systems\u201d (s) designed specifically to defeat them. Unlike armour, which is intended to limit damage to a vehicle if it is hit, s are there to stop missiles striking in the first place. Armies around the world are experimenting with, and deploying, them. The war in Ukraine will add urgency to that task.s come in two varieties, dubbed \u201csoft-kill\u201d and \u201chard-kill\u201d. Soft-kill systems divert a missile by interfering with its guidance systems\u2014for instance, by dazzling them with infrared light or lasers. Hard-kill systems are intended to destroy missiles in flight.The war in Ukraine shows the limitations of the soft-kill approach, says Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank in London. \u201cYou need a good technical understanding of the system you\u2019re trying to defeat.\u201d The potpourri of s fielded by Ukrainian soldiers comes with many different guidance systems. Jamming all of them is impossible.But hard-kill systems have problems, too. You need sophisticated radar to detect incoming missiles, and precise aim to hit them. Anti-tank missiles travel at hundreds of metres a second, so quick reaction times are vital.The Soviet Drozd system, one of the first hard-kill s, was initially deployed in the 1980s, in the wake of the \u2019s invasion of Afghanistan. It fired shells full of shotgun-like pellets at incoming missiles. Afghanit, Drozd\u2019s most recent successor, is built into Russia\u2019s brand-new -14 tanks. But Russia has struggled to construct enough of these. As best as analysts can tell, few -equipped tanks have so far been sent into Ukraine.The army that is furthest along with hard-kill s is Israel\u2019s. Its Trophy system is designed by Rafael, a firm in Haifa, and is fitted to the country\u2019s Merkava tanks. Trophy fires a tight spread of precisely aimed projectiles, the idea being to minimise the danger the system poses to nearby friendly infantry. Israel\u2019s army claims that Trophy has defeated many anti-tank rocket attacks in Gaza\u2014though Mr Hawkes notes that such attacks are probably from older, less sophisticated s. Trophy has attracted interest from abroad, too. America and Germany have equipped some tanks with it and Britain is running trials.There are downsides to such defences. s take up weight, space and power\u2014all precious commodities in a tank. Western tanks, in particular, says Mr Watling, have little room to grow heavier without compromising performance. And hard-kill systems may protect against only a handful of incoming rounds, since debris from a successful interception is likely to damage the delicate radar on which the system relies. Crafty enemies could rake tanks with machine-gun fire to disable this radar before the fact, says Mr Watling.But a defence does not have to be perfect to be useful. Mr Hawkes talks of multilayered, \u201conion-style\u201d defences, in which screening infantry spot threats, smoke can obscure a tank\u2019s location, and armour then protects the target if all else fails. Russia\u2019s experience in Ukraine suggests adding another layer to that onion could prove useful indeed.

{"title": "What can Russia do to sell its unwanted oil?", "content": "ON FEBRUARY 22ND, two days before Russia invaded Ukraine, a German-flagged vessel left the Russian port of Primorsk loaded with 33,000 tonnes of oil.

When it reached Tranmere, a British oil terminal, on March 3rd, it received a frosty welcome. Some dockers refused to unload the freight when they learnt where it had come from.

Kayrros, a data firm, estimates that the volume of oil \u201con water\u201d rose by nearly 13% in the fortnight after the invasion, in large part as undelivered Russian cargo sought new takers. The number of vessels returning to Russia also jumped.Most of what has flowed out of Russia in recent weeks was bought and paid for before the war started. Now less oil is leaving the country in the first place. Worries about sanctions and bad publicity have prompted many buyers to pause purchases. On March 24th the volume of Russian seaborne oil exports, at 2.3m barrels per day (bpd), was nearly 2m below the level on March 1st, reckons Kpler, a data firm. As those barrels fail to sell, the price of Brent crude is nearing $115. Yet for the countries willing to risk opprobrium and jump through new logistical hoops, Russian oil is beginning to look like a bargain.The partial embargo of Russia has echoes with the blockade of Iran by the West in the 2010s, which led the Islamic Republic to put together an unrivalled playbook for smuggling oil. In May 2018 America imposed \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d sanctions, with the aim of halting Iran\u2019s oil exports altogether. It almost succeeded: by October 2019 they had fallen to an average of 260,000 bpd, from 2.3m before the sanctions. Since then, however, they have revived a little, averaging 850,000 bpd in the three months to February 2022.Iran manages to sell oil through two channels. The first is through authorised but restricted sales. As it imposed its sanctions America granted a limited exemption to eight importing countries. There is a big catch, however: the sales have to be made in the buyers\u2019 currency and either kept in escrow accounts at local banks or spent on a list of goods produced locally. For Iran that is deeply frustrating. In December it was forced to accept tea from Sri Lanka as payment for an oil debt valued at $251m.To circumvent the restrictions Iran smuggles vast quantities of oil\u2014its second channel for sales. Iranian tankers sail to America\u2019s foes, such as Venezuela, with their transponders turned off. Some are repainted to hide their provenance. Others transfer their cargo in the high seas, often at night, to ships sailing under a different flag. Oil is also moved over land by smuggling gangs, says Julia Friedlander, a former intelligence official now at the Atlantic Council, a think-tank in Washington. Petroleum is bartered with China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates against gold, pesticides and even housing projects in Tehran. Traders in Dubai, home to half a million Iranians, blend crude from the Islamic Republic with other, similar grades which they then rebrand as Kuwaiti oil.Russia is unlikely to take a leaf out of Iran\u2019s book, mainly because, for now, it doesn\u2019t need to. The penalties imposed on Iran include secondary sanctions that threaten third-country banks dealing with it with huge fines. That makes overtly buying its oil risky. By contrast, Russia faces a weaker embargo. Only America, which did not buy much to begin with, has banned its oil. On March 25th Germany said it would cut its purchases by half, but it is unclear when that would start. Sales transmitted through pipelines, which are less conspicuous than shipments and represent about a fifth of Russia\u2019s total exports of crude, are still flowing. Secondary sanctions have not been imposed.Instead seaborne exports have cratered because Western buyers, such as big energy firms, fear a public backlash. They also face logistical headaches as cautious banks cut credit, ship owners struggle to obtain insurance and freight costs soar. And each time sanctions are tweaked, says Antonia Tzinova of Holland & Knight, a law firm, compliance staff must study hundreds of pages of legalese, making many Russian deals hardly worth the hassle. As a result, Urals crude, the grade pumped out by Russia, is currently trading at a discount of around $31 a barrel. One trader expects the gap to hit $40 within a week\u2019s time.Two big countries that have not joined in with the West\u2019s sanctions\u2014India and China\u2014sense a bargain to be had. India is certainly acting on the opportunity. Russian ship loadings headed for the subcontinent are expected to have risen to 230,000 bpd in March, up from nothing in the previous three months (this excludes , a blend of mainly Kazakh and Russian crude). Yet India is unlikely to buy much, at least in the short term. Nearly half its imports come from the Middle East, and shipping from the Gulf is much cheaper than shipping from Russia. Payment cannot be settled in dollars, requiring India to experiment with a rouble-rupee mechanism (see ).Adi Imsirovic, a former oil-trading boss of Gazprom now at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies, does not see India buying more than 10m barrels a month. This is small, considering that Russia\u2019s pool of unwanted oil is expected by the International Energy Agency, an official forecaster, to reach 3m bpd in April.Only China, then, can save Russia. It imports a total of about 10.5m bpd (11% of the world\u2019s daily production). Mr Imsirovic thinks China could opportunistically increase its purchases to 12m bpd. That could allow it to buy 60m from Russia in relatively short order. It helps that China has lots of empty storage.None of this is happening yet. Even for China, transporting oil from Russia has become harder. Whereas shipment from Russia to Europe usually takes three or four days, to Asia it takes 40. Oil must be loaded onto bigger tankers, which is slow and costly. Chinese banks are loth to lend.Payment is another problem. Financiers in Hong Kong, who have ample access to greenbacks, have helped North Korea receive hard currency in the past. But Russia\u2019s energy deals would be far too large to hide in the city\u2019s financial system, says a trade lawyer. And its main regulator would not turn a blind eye to such dealings, lest they lead America to suspend Hong Kong\u2019s ability to clear dollars locally, a privilege central to its economy.One fix, however, is for Russia to use Chinese bank accounts within China to receive payment in yuan. Those accounts could then be used to finance imports of essential goods, avoiding the cross-border dimension of trade accounting.China may also be biding its time. Even with the extra costs, buying Russian oil would save lots of money. And Chinese traders know a bargain when they see one: when the oil price neared single digits during the covid-induced downturn of 2020, they stocked up to the gills. As Russia\u2019s trading position weakens, the Urals discount will go up. So will China\u2019s purchases.Such a move will not be easily reversed. Most refineries are configured to guzzle certain types of crude, meaning switching from the high-sulphur Urals variety to, say, Saudi Arabia\u2019s super light takes time and money. That in turn suggests Russia\u2019s push into Asia and Europe\u2019s scramble for supplies could reshape the global market. Much of North Sea oil usually goes east; more of it might now stay in Europe. The continent will probably also buy more from West Africa and America, and crank up its imports of sulphur-rich grades from the Gulf. The rest of the world\u2014Asia included\u2014will have to content itself with what Europe does not want. Oil from the Tupi field in Brazil already trades at twice the premium to Brent than usual.The result of this more fragmented global oil-trading system will be a structurally higher price for importers. Until the war petroleum generally flowed seamlessly from oilfields to the fuel tanks that needed it most. Now, says Ben Luckock of Trafigura, a trading firm, that finely tuned system has been disrupted.

Their revenues are equivalent to nearly 2% of Vietnamese .Having made Vingroup into a dominant force at home, its founder and chairman, Pham Nhat Vuong, now wants to turn it into a household name abroad.

On March 29th, in the most audacious move yet, VinFast said it would invest $2bn in its first foreign factory, to be built in North Carolina with capacity to make 150,000 s a year.That is quite a ride for a firm that began life in 1993 making instant noodles in Ukraine, where Mr Vuong found himself after studying geological engineering in the Soviet Union. He subsequently expanded operations to his home country and in 2010 sold the Ukrainian business to Nestl\u00e9, a Swiss food giant, for a reported $150m. The Vietnamese arm became Vingroup. It has been accruing business lines ever since, turning Mr Vuong, who retains a majority stake in the parent company, into Vietnam\u2019s richest man.Between 2011 and 2021 Vingroup\u2019s revenues exploded nearly 50-fold, to more than $5bn. Gross operating profit has ballooned ten-fold in the past decade, to around $800m. Vingroup\u2019s share price is also 50 times what it was at its initial public offering in 2007. It spun off Vincom Retail in 2017 and Vinhomes a year later, retaining majority stakes in both. These lucrative property businesses generate most of the parent company\u2019s profits.Now Vingroup wants more to come from techier sectors, says Le Thi Thu Thuy, Mr Vuong\u2019s deputy at Vingroup and  of VinFast. In particular, the company is eyeing s. To that end, the group is rejigging its industrial divisions.

As part of the electric shift VinFast will also stop making petrol-driven vehicles by the end of this year.The plan is to conquer the global  market with snazzy new models\u2014and a crafty new business model. VinFast will sell cars while leasing their batteries, which account for a large chunk of an \u2019s cost. That lowers the sticker price, as well as alleviating concerns about long-term decline in range as batteries degrade (the company will replace those which no longer recharge adequately). VinFast\u2019s $41,000 8 is one of the cheapest electric s around, even after you factor in the $100 or so monthly battery payments.Vietnam\u2019s president, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, whom Mr Vuong took for a spin in a 8 at VinFast\u2019s factory in Haiphong earlier this year, certainly looked impressed. Afterwards Mr Phuc reiterated just how Vingroup\u2019s business objectives dovetail with the government\u2019s economic goals. These include the creation of large, internationally competitive conglomerates in the mould of South Korean  such as Samsung. No Vietnamese company fits the bill better than Vingroup.Ambition does not, though, guarantee success. Vingroup\u2019s industrial businesses, of which carmaking is by far the biggest, recorded a net loss of about $1bn last year. Chris Robinson of Lux Research, an analysis firm, is sceptical about VinFast\u2019s ability to compete with established carmakers like Volkswagen, which is ploughing billions into affordable s, or Tesla, the industry superstar. He reckons VinFast will struggle to win a big market share outside South-East Asia. Wall Street\u2019s enthusiasm for upstart  firms has chilled of late in America, which could dash VinFast\u2019s hopes for a blockbuster New York listing. The world\u2019s motorists and investors may prove harder to impress than Mr Phuc.

In East Kalimantan, on Borneo, which produces nearly two-fifths of Indonesia\u2019s palm oil, at least two homemakers have died this month while queuing.In February Indonesia\u2019s government capped the retail price of cooking oil (made from palm oil) at 14,000 rupiah ($1) a litre for the highest-quality oil, and 11,500 rupiah for the cheaper sort. Overnight, shelves emptied across the country of 273m people. For most Indonesians, imported oil is an unaffordable luxury. On March 16th the price cap was lifted and stocks miraculously reappeared. But in the process, prices have more than tripled.Yeka Hendra Fatika, of the government ombudsman, which monitors cooking-oil prices throughout 274 markets in Indonesia, blames the price rise on factors including the war in Ukraine and the pandemic. By February, the price of crude palm oil ( had spiked by 40% year on year. Hoping to curb the retail price of an important commodity, the government in January imposed a 20% \u201cdomestic market obligation\u201d () for all producers\u2014ie, the share of output they must offer on the local market before exporting. In early March this was raised to 30%. Then, after suppliers resisted fiercely, the government a week later did away with the , in favour of charging higher export levies on .Cooking oil under the initial  scheme was sold at a fixed price, which producers said made it hard to cover the cost of materials. Mr Yeka says it was \u201cthe big disparity between  and  prices that caused the panic buying and stockpiling that ensued\u201d.Arie Rompas of Greenpeace Indonesia, an environmental lobby, says the government should \u201cgo after the oligarchs of the industry, which frequently stockpiles supply.\u201d In 2019 Indonesia produced 47.1m tonnes of , of which 76% was exported. Eddy Hartono of the Indonesian Palm Oil Association, known as , a producers\u2019 lobby, says the initial 20%  easily exceeded local demand, and oil was being lost somewhere in the distribution chain. Indeed, in mid-March, a government commission found millions of tonnes of cooking oil stockpiled by conglomerates. State prosecutors in Jakarta, looking into the shortage of cooking oil, say they are investigating the role of cartels.Whatever the cause of the shortage and price rises, few want to make do with less cooking oil.

Cutting it is the front line in Ethiopia\u2019s 17-month-old civil war between the forces of Abiy Ahmed, the national prime minister, and the Tigrayan People\u2019s Liberation Front (), the party-cum-militia that runs Tigray. The road is the only route authorised by the government for aid shipments into Tigray, where hundreds of thousands are starving. No food has moved along it since the middle of December.The Semera-Mekele highway is thus the proving ground of the \u201cindefinite humanitarian truce\u201d that the government announced on March 24th and that Tigrayan leaders provisionally accepted. If it holds, it could help bring an end to a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives (no official figures are available) and that still threatens to tear Ethiopia apart. The first crucial test is whether aid starts moving along the main road. If it does not, then the fighting could swiftly resume.As  went to press, telecommunications were still cut off and no lorries were heading to Tigray. Aid workers say this is because the road through Afar, a region mostly under government control, is still too dangerous to use. There have been skirmishes with Tigrayan forces nearby. Many Afars are furious about Tigrayan incursions, which have left hundreds of thousands homeless and hungry. Some have attacked shipments of aid in recent weeks. \u201cFirst, feed Afar,\u201d says Mussa Adem, an opposition leader in the region.Part of the problem is a lack of agreement about what the ceasefire actually means. The  has indicated that aid must flow before its troops will withdraw to Tigray\u2019s borders. The government seems to think the opposite. Both are already crying foul. On March 28th the  accused the government of lying about lifting its blockade. The government accused Tigrayan forces of blocking the road.Some suspect the government\u2019s real aim is to buy time while staving off the threat of American sanctions. \u201cYou can\u2019t call it a humanitarian truce and then condition it on a withdrawal,\u201d says a Western diplomat. That Abiy has not made visible efforts to make sure aid gets through Afar unimpeded only adds to such concerns.Still, there are some grounds for thinking that both sides are inching closer to ending the war. The , which last year seemed set to storm the capital, Addis Ababa, has since suffered setbacks on the battle field and is unable to relieve the suffering of civilians. Thousands of Tigrayans are crossing into the neighbouring Amhara region to escape hunger and drone strikes inflicted on them by government forces. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve got much wiggle room,\u201d says a  official, referring to the .Indirect talks mediated by America and the African Union have begun bearing fruit. Military commanders have made contact and both sides have toned down their rhetoric. Fighting is much less intense than it was last year. Since January the government has released many Tigrayans from prison, including some  leaders. A three-month state of emergency was lifted in February.Asked to explain the government\u2019s shift, a senior official from the ruling party says, \u201cDiplomatic pressure, the economy, war-weariness\u2014in that order.\u201d David Satterfield, America\u2019s special envoy for the Horn of Africa, was in Addis Ababa days before the ceasefire was announced. America has already suspended duty-free access for Ethiopian goods and two bills on further sanctions are currently before Congress.Ethiopia\u2019s economy is collapsing. Spending on the war has exacerbated a shortage of foreign currency. Banks are running dry and factories are cutting back for want of imported materials. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine means inflation may climb from its current rate of 34%. \u201cThere is no choice but to end the war,\u201d says a central banker. \u201cThe economic consequence is beyond what the country can bear.\u201dEven so, progress towards peace may yet founder. In recent days busloads of Ethiopian troops have been seen moving north towards Tigray.  leaders warn ominously of launching a new offensive should aid not arrive soon. \u201cPeople are losing patience,\u201d says a Tigrayan diplomat.

A third made it to six hours, and a fourth to six days. The skull of one baby was crushed. The skull of another, after nine attempts at delivery, at times with forceps, was fractured on both sides.The final Ockenden Report, published on March 30th after years of campaigning by bereaved parents (two are pictured), does not make for easy reading. It looks at the maternity care provided by Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital  Trust over two decades. Its 250 pages are unprecedented in  history, in length and scale\u2014and, arguably, in condemnatory tone. Although finely detailed\u2014noting the strength of this mother\u2019s contractions; when that mother\u2019s waters broke; when this baby ceased breathing\u2014its chief finding is simple. This report, writes Donna Ockenden, the midwife who led it, \u201cis about an  maternity service that failed\u201d.Those failures came in many forms, over many years. Ms Ockenden and a team of midwives and doctors looked at the maternity care provided to 1,486 families, chiefly between 2000 and 2019. They found that 131 stillbirths, 70 neonatal deaths and nine maternal deaths might have been avoided, had care been better. A police investigation has been under way for some time. The trust often failed to investigate serious incidents, sometimes even when a patient died. When complaints were responded to, those responses \u201coften lacked compassion\u201d and at times \u201cimplied that the woman herself was to blame\u201d.No one claims that childbirth is easy. When at rest, the diameter of the average woman\u2019s cervix is less than 1cm\u2014less than the length of the word \u201ccervix\u201d written in this font. The average baby\u2019s head has a diameter a little over 10cm. To get the second through the first is hard, and always has been. Roman gynaecological manuals advised on tools such as the \u201cembryo-crusher\u201d, used to remove babies who had become stuck. In the worst countries in the world maternal mortality lurks at over 1,100 deaths per 100,000 births; in the best it is still two.But disaster need not strike anywhere near as often as in Shrewsbury and Telford. Ideology was one culprit. Childbirth is a biological process that has become peculiarly politicised. Jeremy Hunt, who ordered the inquiry when he was health secretary, says that the \u201cnatural-birth ideology\u201d that flourished at that time \u201cproved to be absolutely catastrophic in Shrewsbury and Telford\u201d. It was not the only problem\u2014Mr Hunt also cites a reluctance to admit mistakes\u2014but it was a dominant one.Ever since Grantly Dick-Read, an obstetrician, published \u201cNatural Childbirth\u201d in the 1930s, there have been people who have argued vehemently that because childbirth is \u201cnatural\u201d it should be endured without pain relief or medical intervention. The natural-childbirth movement gained support not only among mothers but also among medical professionals. In 2008 the Royal College of Midwives launched a campaign for \u201cnormal birth\u201d, in which it advised midwives to \u201ctrust your intuition\u201d and \u201cwait and see\u201d before intervening. The relentless rise in Caesarean sections in Britain in recent decades has often been greeted with hand-wringing.Without doubt, there are advantages to giving birth without drugs and scalpels. A Caesarean is a gruelling operation. Ideally it would be followed by weeks of bed rest; instead it is followed by months of broken nights, and days spent lugging a grizzling baby about. If one can be avoided, it should be. But only when all relevant factors are taken into account\u2014and a target for natural childbirths is not one of those.Few women give birth today without having been at least exposed to, at worst oppressed by, the notion that a \u201cnatural\u201d birth is not merely physically superior, but ideologically superior, too. This dogma seems to have held sway in Shrewsbury and Telford. Mr Hunt observes that the trust \u201cmade a big deal\u201d of its very low Caesarean-section rate: in 2005 it was around 14%, compared with a national average of 23.2%. When one woman pregnant with twins requested a Caesarean, a doctor is said to have replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve got the lowest Caesarean rate in the country and we are proud of it and we plan to keep it that way.\u201d One of her twins died.

Scotland, where the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is demanding a second independence referendum next year?

In Northern Ireland the Brexit protocol is leading to closer economic ties with the republic, but not a new wave of support for a . Any referendum in Scotland or Wales would require Mr Johnson\u2019s permission, which he has made clear he will not give. None of the independence movements has gone beyond a back-of-the-envelope sketch of how their breakaway country would be run.Supporters of the union are therefore winning. But for the union to survive is not the same as for it to thrive. If the United Kingdom is to do any better than lurch from one crisis to the next, it needs a new constitutional settlement.Under New Labour, the devolved parliaments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast were meant to bring bread-and-butter issues, such as health care and schooling, before each country\u2019s voters. Instead such issues are neglected, because elections are dominated by unresolved arguments about the constitution. The Scottish National Party () has been sustained in office despite its poor stewardship of schools and hospitals, because it monopolises pro-independence voters. In Northern Ireland a crisis looms. Sinn Fein, which favours a united Ireland, is likely to win the most seats in the assembly election in May. The Democratic Unionist Party (), which opposes reunification, may refuse to share power with it, and cause the government to collapse.Relations with Westminster are dysfunctional, too. Under devolution, powers were crudely handed out around the United Kingdom, but the politics favour blaming the centre rather than working with it. London and Edinburgh are clashing over whether to widen a Scottish road carrying freight arriving by sea from Northern Ireland to England. Attempts to build new nuclear power stations or drill for gas have been stymied, because energy policy is set in London whereas planning is devolved.A better combination of devolution and centralisation would compel governments to work together. Leaders in Scotland and Wales want more say over issues that affect all of Britain, such as immigration and relations with the European Union. They should get it. In exchange, they should let Westminster co-ordinate areas of national importance, such as major transport links and energy security. Tougher central scrutiny is needed, too. If schools in Scotland or hospitals in Wales are failing, Westminster has a legitimate role in helping turn them around.If the  tries to block devolution from being restored in May, Westminster should remove the veto power wielded by Northern Ireland\u2019s two largest parties, one of which backs the union and the other a united Ireland. Making assembly rules fairer would boost parties that are neither unionist nor republican. The political culture needs to change, too. The  should accept that its dream of independence will not soon be fulfilled. It is failing its own people if it chooses not to work with Westminster partly for fear that they may become content with the status quo. For their part, the Conservatives should stop using the spectre of secession to stir up their own English voters.Last, the heat needs to be taken out of Brexit, which further strained the union. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, is right to seek a new deal with the  on the flow of goods to and from Northern Ireland, and to downplay threats to trigger Article 16, the suspension clause of the Brexit treaty. Softening the sharp edges of Brexit, for example by making it easier for students and artists to travel, would make remaining in a United Kingdom outside the  more palatable for the majorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland who voted to remain within the bloc.The union has proved surprisingly robust in the face of the threats of Brexit, rising separatism and Mr Johnson\u2019s populism. Devolution enshrined the noble principle that the nations of the United Kingdom should take control of their own affairs while working in a greater whole. It is an idea worth saving.

Until recently I had little comprehension of the country \u2013 and I was born there.It\u2019s easy to see why Ukraine confuses people. To the uninformed outsider, it confounds all ideas of what makes a nation. Most people are casually bilingual. It contains many histories simultaneously: the Russian, Soviet and Austro-Hungarian empires, Poland, Romania and, of course, Ukraine itself. This lattice of historical narratives has made many in the West feel as though the country is not quite real.Now people are more clued up. The world has found its hero nation. Its Jewish president, a one-time comedian who matured into a younger, more empathetic Churchill. The elderly women taunting Russian soldiers. The hipsters picking up machine guns. The distraught yet articulate mothers with their sparkling children sheltering underground. The beauty blogger on Instagram bombed in a maternity ward.Ukrainians have reminded us what freedom means \u2013 a word that for many in rich democracies had long ago curdled into platitudes. The resilience of the population has impressed the West and surprised the Kremlin. It shouldn\u2019t have. For the past few years I\u2019ve been trying to unlock the secret of Ukrainian identity by talking to Ukrainians. Through my research project, Arena, based originally at the  and now at Johns Hopkins University, I\u2019ve worked with Ukrainian journalists and sociologists to find ways of strengthening democracy. My team has interviewed thousands of adults across the country. Our fieldwork shows that the response to Russia\u2019s invasion has deep roots in Ukrainian history.  was born in Kyiv in 1977 to Ukrainian parents. My family was exiled from the Soviet Union when I was nine months old, after my father, a poet, was arrested by the  for the heinous crime of distributing copies of books by Solzhenitsyn and Nabokov to friends.Yet I never thought of myself as particularly Ukrainian. I grew up in London speaking Russian and was regarded as \u201cthe Russian\u201d by my schoolmates. I first visited Ukraine when I was 18, and I was astounded: the sweeping Soviet avenues backing into hills with wild woods; the smells of beer and (stuffed buns) wafting between pastel-coloured, art-nouveau apartment blocks; the river so broad it feels almost like a sea. Kyiv is a city of shrugs that never takes itself too seriously. It is made for strolling through and kissing in. People switch languages so rhythmically your ears are lulled by sing-song waves of Russian and Ukrainian. When I visited in the fourth week of the war, the city was empty. The tension was occasionally torn by the scream of sirens. But it was more beautiful than ever. The elegant buildings were easier to see in absence of people and cars, and the threat of imminent destruction made the streets seem all the more precious.In 2014 Putin\u2019s forces invaded and occupied the country\u2019s easternmost fringe, after the Maidan unseated as president his kleptocratic ally Viktor Yanukovych. Putin claimed that he was defending ethnic Russians. It felt like an attack not just on my friends, family and a country I had been getting to know, but also on a cosmopolitan way of living and thinking.My work turned towards Ukraine and the Kremlin\u2019s information war. The Russian government\u2019s aim was to divide and weaken the country in order, it now seems clear, to prepare the ground for invasion. Russian state media, online troll farms and, perhaps most perniciously, the gaggle of immensely rich pro-Russian oligarchs combined to undermine democratic reforms, smear the West and fracture Ukraine\u2019s sense of unity. As we were pursuing our research, through polling, focus groups and in-depth interviews, the Kremlin\u2019s secret services were conducting theirs, looking for Ukraine\u2019s vulnerabilities. We always felt like we were in a race to understand Ukrainians better. Our team started by trying to understand their attitudes to history. To validate his invasions, Putin has called the Ukrainian government \u201cNazis\u201d and described the invasion as an act of \u201cdenazification\u201d. The slur is absurd but also strategic. Some prominent Ukrainian nationalists sided with the Nazis in the second world war because they thought Hitler would grant Ukraine independence; a number of them were comfortable with the Nazis\u2019 anti-Semitism. When Hitler betrayed them, many turned on the Germans and fought against both them and the Soviet Union. In Soviet post-war propaganda, Ukrainian nationalists were caricatured as the fascist enemy of the good Soviet citizen. Anyone who grew up steeped in that milieu is receptive to this framing. Putin and his supporters have tried to split the country between a supposed pro-Soviet east and pro-nationalist west. However, our polling found this split to be a mirage. There were at least four distinct groups. The Ukrainians who were most pro-Soviet were older, often pensioners, and less educated, living largely in rural areas in the south and east of the country. A tiny proportion of the population, less than 5%, approved of Stalin (the equivalent figure in Russia is 70%). The memory of the Holodomor, Stalin\u2019s man-made famine which killed roughly 4m Ukrainians in 1932-33, still burns. Another group was younger and better educated, and lived in large cities in the south and east such as Odessa and Kharkiv. The attitude of these people to the Soviet Union was more nuanced. Although they were critical of its repression, they tended to be nostalgic for the supposed social \u201cvalues\u201d of the communist past and harboured negative attitudes towards Ukrainian nationalists who fought against the Red Army in the second world war.The group that most disliked the Soviet Union were the educated middle classes in cities in central and western Ukraine. Comprising a third of the population, these people were more likely to admire Stepan Bandera, a leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement in the second world war who first sided with the Nazis and then fell out with them. Bandera is, to put it mildly, a complex figure. He was inspired by Italian fascism but spent most of the war imprisoned by the Nazis. Many of his supporters during the second world war were ardent anti-Semites. Paradoxically we found that today, liberals who believed that anyone could be Ukrainian regardless of their background thought of him in the most positive light. They admired him for standing up to the tyrants of Moscow, rather than for his ethno-nationalist beliefs.The splits were typical of the divide between liberal cities and the socially conservative countryside found in many European countries \u2013 but they did not equate to political preferences. The vast majority of people across Ukraine had a similar vision of the future: they wanted a culture of inclusive nationalism within the European Union.When we put Soviet nostalgics in a room with Ukrainian patriots, there were plenty of disagreements over whether it was right to tear down Soviet-era statues or whether Bandera was an admirable figure. Yet we also found that people were quick to accommodate each other\u2019s perspectives. \u201cIf someone needs a statue of Bandera, let them have one,\u201d a woman from eastern Ukraine told us.Both groups seemed aware that politicians were always trying to split the country and were wary of being manipulated. \u201cThere is no separation, we are united. We are just separated by an information war,\u201d said one contributor. We held our focus groups just after Volodymyr Zelensky was elected in April 2019: he drew on dissatisfaction with the politics of polarisation to win a resounding 70% of the vote. His  career evoked Soviet-era acting styles and comedy references, but he had a capitalist appreciation for entrepreneurship. During the campaign, Zelensky was accused by opponents of being ideologically vague and reluctant to talk about history. Perhaps this was part of his attraction: he embodied a profound Ukrainian tradition of knowing how to get along with people whose story differs from your own.Our research showed that Ukraine had a culture of live and let live. The supposedly pro-Russian cities of Kharkiv and Odessa pride themselves on their cosmopolitanism. In the west, apparently nationalist cities such as Lviv have always echoed with a cacophony of tongues and churches. Ukrainians are accustomed to switching between codes and languages. They are united by knowledge of their differences.When we began talking about more recent history, disagreements about statues of Lenin and second-world-war partisans rapidly melted away. Participants tried to find the words to describe life in the late Soviet period: their experiences of the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl; memories of seeing relatives sent off to war in Afghanistan; the economic deprivation and confusion of the 1990s. The struggle to make sense of these events was hard, because people often avoided discussing them. \u201cMy family hasn\u2019t talked about it [the Soviet period] at all,\u201d one participant admitted. People would sometimes switch to the passive as they spoke, a sign of how little agency they felt about their country\u2019s recent history, using such phrases as \u201cwhen independence happened to us\u201d.Ukrainians have been oppressed by the Habsburgs, the Russian Empire, the Poles, the Nazis and the Soviet Union. Even Czechoslovakia once snaffled a slice of western Ukraine. Ukrainian oligarchs have acted like another set of exploitative colonisers since independence in 1991. In the 20th century alone, some 14m people are believed to have been killed in Ukraine through purges, famine and the Holocaust. Timothy Snyder, a historian, calls this region the \u201cBloodlands\u201d. The term \u201cgenocide\u201d was invented by a lawyer from Lviv.\u201cThe Ukrainian choice is the choice between a non-existence and an existence that kills you\u201d, wrote Oksana Zabuzhko in \u201cFieldwork in Ukrainian Sex\u201d (1996), a novel about how trauma is passed down from generation to generation. The protagonist is a Ukrainian writer caught in an abusive love affair. \u201cWe were raised by men fucked from all ends every which way,\u201d she writes. This, in turn, leads to a pattern of abusive relationships where self-loathing men take their anger out on women. It\u2019s an allegorical work: the couple\u2019s relationship represents a country where the history of oppression permeates everything from art to relationships. That history of violence and humiliation has led Ukrainians to think conspiratorially. Over two-thirds of people we talked to for our study reckoned that \u201csecret organisations\u201d greatly influence political decisions. Such attitudes are understandable but damaging. Even in the days leading up to February 24th, many members of the Ukrainian elite thought that American warnings of an imminent Russian invasion were secretly a means to push the country into making concessions. They didn\u2019t take Putin\u2019s intentions seriously until the last minute. ecause rulers have historically been colonising powers, Ukrainians have little trust in government. Zelenksy\u2019s popularity began to drain from the moment he came to power (before the war his approval rating was just 30%). This lack of respect for authority means that Ukrainians can energetically overthrow rulers, as they did in 2004 and 2014. But it also makes it hard to build an effective bureaucracy. The state is seen as something that needs to be avoided or that can be used for personal gain. Corruption is the grease that makes things work. Courts are captured by anyone who can pay. This attitude infuriates reformers and western donors like the . Even when the government does manage to build new infrastructure, people talk about these achievements as though they happened almost magically. Ukrainians simply can\u2019t conceive of the state doing anything successfully.The Russian secret services seem to have thought this mindset was a fatal weakness: according to the Royal United Services Institute, a British think-tank, the Kremlin based its invasion plans on surveys that predicted Ukrainian support for the government would collapse after an invasion. But there is a flipside to all this distrust. People have learnt to rely on each other. Ukrainians pride themselves on resilience and cunning. They have always found ways to self-organise. Trust in civil society, in local churches and small-business associations is high. There are also less savoury associations: football hooligans, petty gangsters and far-right militias who formed regiments to fight in the Donbas after 2014. Calamity has forced people to club together. \u201cDisaster and grief unite us,\u201d people would say when we asked. Many of our interviewees spoke about how, in 2014, activists took it upon themselves to feed, clothe and provide transport for Ukraine\u2019s decrepit army. Ukrainian myths of national identity coalesce around a collective: the Cossacks, bands of self-governing warriors who roamed the steppe. A recent successful film told the story of how Ukrainian Jews and Crimean Tatars created underground networks to help each other in the second world war, to fight first the Nazis and then the . One of the most popular Christmas films in Ukraine is \u201cHome Alone\u201d, which has a narrative that resonates with Ukraine\u2019s story: a small country abandoned by the world\u2019s parents, always attacked by bigger powers and having to improvise self-defence with anything that comes to hand.In this war, Ukrainians are showing that they can resist one of their most frequent and violent abusers, the Kremlin. Among the friends I speak to there\u2019s a sense that they are fighting not just against this invasion, but for all the other times Ukraine has been violated. Putin himself referred to the invasion as a rape: \u201cYou sleep my beauty, you\u2019re going to have to put up with it anyway,\u201d he told a stunned press pack during a session with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. In Lviv today you see posters of a woman in Ukrainian folk costume pushing a gun into Putin\u2019s mouth: \u201cI\u2019m not your beauty,\u201d she says. We presented our latest research in Kyiv on Wednesday February 23rd. I joined over Zoom, and saw the sense of dread and anger settle over the room of bright young things. The next day the Russian tanks rolled in, scattering our team. Some have become temporary refugees. The journalists are reporting from the front lines. Others have taken up arms. Denys Kobzyn, our lead sociologist in Kharkiv, sent me a selfie with a machine gun draped over his shoulder. Our work hasn\u2019t stopped. We\u2019re planning a multimedia oral-history project, to record people\u2019s testimony of the bombings, the rape of women and the attacks on refugees, so that when the cameras leave we can still help Ukrainians to tell their story \u2013 in war-crimes tribunals, in films and plays, in books and exhibitions.A curious answer emerged from our research last year about \u201cwhat unites Ukrainians\u201d. When we asked people when they felt most proud to be Ukrainian, they almost always remembered a moment of international recognition when they felt that Ukraine had been noticed. Often these were tiny things: a Ukrainian child winning an international maths competition; a foreigner mentioning to them on holiday that they knew where Ukraine was.At the time I thought this yearning was essentially about identity, a desire to be known. In Zabuzhko\u2019s \u201cFieldwork of Ukrainian Sex\u201d, the heroine travels from one international literary seminar to the next, impelled to prove that Ukrainian is a living language, and exhausted by the need to constantly answer the question \u201cUkraine? Where\u2019s that?\u201d Now I realise this desire to be seen is not just about identity; it\u2019s also about security. Being seen by the world means that there is less chance that you will get killed.  directs the Arena project at Johns Hopkins University and is the author of \u201cThis is Not Propaganda: Adventures in the War Against Reality\u201d.

The , our sister company, has measured government actions globally since the war broke out, and countries\u2019 historical ties with Russia, to divide the world into three broad categories: governments that are West-leaning, Russia-leaning and neutral amid .A total of 131 countries are against Russia, according to the analysis. Most rich ones in North America and Europe fall into this club. Even historically neutral governments, such as those in Finland, Sweden and Switzerland, have taken a decisive stance against the invasion. According to the EIU, the West-leaning camp accounts for more than 70% of the world\u2019s GDP.But together the countries opposing Russia account for only 36% of the world\u2019s population. Around two-thirds of people live in countries whose governments are either neutral or Russian-leaning. China and India, which together account for around one-third of the global population, skew the results. The Chinese government, classified as Russia-leaning by the EIU, has avoided direct condemnation of Mr Putin\u2019s actions and is unlikely to stand with the West. , classed as neutral, has increased its engagement with the Russian government, especially through . It is not just the governments of these hugely populous countries that are neutral or Russia-leaning. According to a survey in India conducted by YouGov, a pollster, in March, 40% of respondents approved of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. Fifty-four per cent of those polled approved of Mr Putin\u2019s leadership (compared with 63% who approved of Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president). No such data have been collected in China but online polls indicate greater support for Russia. About 30% of the global population live in the 28 countries whose governments are classed by the EIU as leaning towards Russia. As well as China, these include such populous places as Pakistan and Ethiopia. For some, such as and Syria, Russia is a key ally. Thirty-two governments have remained neutral, including Bangladesh\u2019s, Brazil\u2019s and India\u2019s. Several developing countries see neutrality as the default foreign-policy choice, a legacy of the non-aligned movement formed during the cold war as a counterbalance against the world\u2019s polarisation into two blocs.Mr Putin\u2019s campaign in Ukraine has met widespread condemnation in the West.

{"title": "The invasion of Ukraine is not the first social media war, but it is the most viral", "content": "YOU HAVE probably seen the videos from Ukraine. There is the one where Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, stands outside Kyiv\u2019s government quarter in dim light, holding his smartphone with the camera pointed selfie-style at himself and several senior officials. \u201cWe are all here,\u201d he declares, days after Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, sent his tanks across the border. Or the one a Ukrainian soldier took, showing his mates in a snowy field firing anti-tank missiles, set to a thumping techno soundtrack. Or the one where a Ukrainian woman approaches a group of Russian soldiers and tells them to put sunflower seeds in their pockets so that something useful will grow from their bodies when they die.Each spread online, generating millions of views and likes, reposts and remixes. They became part of the instant digital annals of the war, alongside pictures of Ukrainian tractors towing abandoned Russian tanks, which is now a global meme, and audio of Ukrainian soldiers at an islet in the Black Sea telling an approaching fleet, \u201cRussian warship: go fuck yourself\u201d, which is now a rallying cry at protests as far away as Tokyo.The war in Ukraine is not, as some commentators rushed to declare, the \u201cfirst social-media war\u201d. Israel and Hamas have long sparred on Twitter as well as IRL. During Mr Putin\u2019s previous invasion of Ukraine, in 2014-15, digital sleuths used selfies that Russian soldiers posted online to prove their presence on the battlefield in the Donbas region. (Russia subsequently barred soldiers from carrying smartphones while on duty.) Nor is the war in Ukraine the first conflict to appear on a new generation of social networks such as TikTok, which launched in 2016. Videos from the war in Syria have long circulated there; those interested could also find plenty of clips from Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed enclave that Armenia and Azerbaijan fought over in 2020.But Ukraine has become the most vivid example yet of how social media are changing the way that war is chronicled, experienced and understood, and how that, in turn, can change the course of a war itself. \u201cAnyone who thinks it is a sideshow isn\u2019t paying attention to war and politics in the 21st century,\u201d says Peter Singer, co-author of #LikeWar, a book about the intersection of social media and modern conflict.Online chatter can spur rapid shifts in public opinion, especially when pre-existing beliefs are reinforced. Posts on social networks have become a crucial source of information for gatherers of open-source intelligence (OSINT) and conventional media alike. Social media can be used as an \u201cinstrument\u201d for governments to achieve wartime aims, says Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine\u2019s minister for digital transformation, who has used Twitter to push for a \u201cdigital blockade\u201d of Russia by global technology firms. Along with rallying NATO and delivering arms to Ukraine, the White House recently held a briefing on the war for 30 young TikTok influencers. \u201cWhether you like it or not, there are a lot of people on these apps,\u201d says Victoria Hammett, who attended as part of Gen-Z for Change, an activist group.The war in Ukraine has saturated those apps. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is the scale of it,\u201d Mr Singer argues. The sheer horror of the war naturally attracts attention. European audiences are especially fascinated because Ukraine is on their doorstep, and they, too, fear Vladimir Putin. Race and psychology may add to the mix: Western audiences may identify more with Ukrainians than Syrians, and thus more readily watch, share or like posts about Ukraine.But Ukraine is also more wired than other recent war zones. Some 75% of Ukrainians use the internet, according to the International Telecommunication Union, part of the UN. Internet access has remained stable in all but the most brutally besieged Ukrainian cities, thanks in part to satellite coverage. When Russian bombers began pounding Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad in 2015, 30% of Syria\u2019s population was online. In Afghanistan at the time of the American withdrawal, the figure stood at less than 20%.The evolution of social media and communications technologies plays a role too. The shifts can be seen in Ukraine itself: when Russia began its war in 2014, just 4% of Ukrainian mobile subscribers had access to networks of 3G speed or faster; this year, more than 80% are on high-speed networks, according to Kepios, a research firm. In 2014 just 14% of Ukrainians had smartphones, reckons Kepios; by 2020 more than 70% did, estimates GSMA, a telecommunications industry body. When Mr Putin launched the recent invasion, 4.6bn people were using social media globally, more than double the number in 2014. Where users once saw content from those they follow in chronological order, they now consume an algorithmic news-feed that promotes the items attracting the most interest. Social networks had limited capacity to display videos or livestreams in 2014, but are now heaving with them, a shift Ukrainians have made the most of. \u201cEveryone is filming and posting every last bombing,\u201d says Maria Popova, a communications executive who now co-ordinates a volunteer movement to gather and disseminate information from Ukraine.Such recordings are the latest stage in the long evolution of the imagery of war. Before the camera, artists had to convince audiences they had witnessed the events they depicted: \u201cI saw this,\u201d Francisco Goya wrote under one of the etchings in his classic series, \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d. Photographers began documenting conflict in the mid-19th century, but cumbersome equipment and processes made capturing combat impossible. Instead, pictures tended to show the aftermath of the fighting, such as in \u201cThe Valley of the Shadow of Death\u201d, Roger Fenton\u2019s iconic image of a cannonball-strewn road during the Crimean War. The invention of lightweight, 35mm cameras made it possible to operate at the frontlines. During the Spanish Civil War, photojournalists took searing pictures of battle that helped mobilise support for the resistance to Franco, such as Robert Capa\u2019s defining snapshot of a Republican soldier falling dead. With the Vietnam war, conflict came to television. Cable news carried the first Gulf war live. As the critic Susan Sontag wrote in 2002, \u201cThe understanding of war among people who have not experienced war is now chiefly a product of the impact of these images.\u201dToday\u2019s instantly shareable, smartphone-fuelled photographs and videos take things a step further. Nathan Jurgenson, a social-media theorist, dubs such images \u201csocial photo\u201d and \u201csocial video\u201d, and reckons their power depends less on the information they convey than on the experience they express. They function more as a means of communication than of documentation. \u201cImages within the social stream evoke more than they explain; they transmit a general alertness to experience rather than facts,\u201d Mr Jurgenson writes. Coexisting alongside traditional photojournalism and television, social photo and video add a rawer, darker, more personal quality to the picture of war outsiders see. \u201cNews reports give you the big bits, but a lot of what I\u2019m seeing [online] is everyday life as the war makes it, like the lines for bread,\u201d says Simon Kemp of Kepios. \u201cThose scenes make it a lot more like, \u2018Fuck, that could be me\u2019\u2014it makes it more human.\u201dUkrainians have adapted deftly to the new information environment. It helps to have a charismatic, social-media savvy leader in Mr Zelensky, a former TV star. His messages often break with the formal presidential approach and embrace the intimate aesthetic of social media, in contrast to his older, staider foe in Moscow. \u201cIt\u2019s organic for him to use technology,\u201d says Mr Fedorov, who ran digital operations for Mr Zelensky\u2019s presidential campaign in 2019. \u201cHe wants to share, wants to spread the word, wants to convey his emotions\u2014like a normal person.\u201d Officials across Ukraine have adopted the same approach. Vitaly Kim, the governor of Mykolaiv, a frontline region in southern Ukraine, posts regular selfie-style videos to his channel on Telegram, a messaging and publishing platform that is widely used in both Ukraine and Russia.The Ukrainian government has taken to social media to pursue various aims. On March 17th Dmytro Kuleba, the foreign minister, sought to embarrass Nestl\u00e9 for refusing to cease all operations in Russia by posting a meme-style image that contrasts \u201cNestle\u2019s positioning\u201d\u2014a picture of a healthy child\u2014with \u201cNestle\u2019s position\u201d\u2014a picture of a dead child. The digital ministry launched a chatbot on Telegram that allows citizens to send videos and locations of Russian forces; it receives around 10,000 messages a day, which Ukraine\u2019s army uses to supplement traditional intelligence. \u201cWherever they may be, we see them,\u201d Mr Fedorov says. The government uses social media to spread everything from information about evacuation trains to stories about heroic soldiers. The tales have been no less powerful even when untrue: the soldiers from the islet in the Black Sea were not killed after delivering their famous line, as Ukraine\u2019s government originally reported, but captured, a fact that has done little to dent their reputation as martyrs.The government has had plenty of help. Across Ukraine, public-relations specialists, designers and other media types have banded together through bottom-up networks that emerged within hours of the invasion. \u201cEverybody is an information warrior these days,\u201d says Liubov Tsybulska, an adviser to the Ukrainian government who helps co-ordinate several teams of them, each with a specific focus. One group packages content aimed at Russians; another produces patriotic clips for a domestic audience; a third focuses on TikTok; a fourth churns out memes; yet others work to archive photos and videos from social media for what they hope will be future war-crimes tribunals. Part of the aim is to make sure the world gets its information about Ukraine directly from Ukraine, says Serhii Didkovsky, a PR strategist who belongs to another network of creative professionals. \u201cWe want a Frenchman sitting in Paris, looking at the Eiffel Tower, eating his croissant, to understand that he can do all of that because the Ukrainian army is defending him,\u201d Mr Didkovsky says.Just as Ukraine has shifted towards the West geopolitically in recent years, so has its online life. When Russia invaded in 2014, Ukraine\u2019s internet culture, like its economy as a whole, was oriented towards Russia. The most popular social network was VK, a Russian platform. In recent years, Ukraine\u2019s tech scene has boomed; many developers and designers work for Western technology companies. \u201cWe have lots of people who know how to design content for the global internet,\u201d Mr Didkovsky says. Ukrainian users speak to Western audiences in a common digital language. A travel photographer who posts as @valerisssh became a viral sensation with videos that applied popular TikTok memes to her life in wartime Chernihiv with humour and pathos. One appropriates an Italian song often used on the platform for videos of users cooking pasta to take her followers on a tour of her family\u2019s bomb shelter.That has helped win hearts and minds in the West. Americans already tended to dislike Russia, and they have been swift to embrace Ukraine. At the end of last year 55% of Americans saw Ukraine as \u201cfriendly\u201d or \u201callied\u201d. Two weeks after Mr Putin\u2019s bombs began falling, more than 80% of Americans did, a greater share than those who thought the same of France or Japan, both longtime allies. Diplomats in Europe say similar shifts in public opinion there have helped galvanise support for tougher sanctions against Russia and a more liberal approach to refugees from Ukraine. The real-time storytelling has also helped boost morale amongst Ukrainians. \u201cWe witness how a new narrative about Ukraine is being born and it gives us strength, gives us courage,\u201d says Ms Tsybulska.Russia has floundered on the information battlefield inside Ukraine as much as on the physical one, despite its reputation as a pioneer of disinformation. Russian occupying forces have handed out fliers appealing to \u201ccomrades\u201d and taken over local radio stations to broadcast speeches by Mr Putin. \u201cThey\u2019re using crap from the second world war,\u201d says Kristina Berdynskykh, a prominent Ukrainian journalist originally from Kherson, a city currently under Russian control. \u201cInformation isn\u2019t spread that way any more.\u201d Residents in occupied cities continue to stream Ukrainian television and radio online and through Diia, a Ukrainian government app. They use Telegram to organise protests and share recordings of the Russian occupiers. Videos of unarmed protesters challenging Russian soldiers have gone viral, including one of a lone man trying to stop a tank with his bare hands.In the West, Russian narratives have gained little traction. That may be because the reality is too stark to spin. Western platforms have also taken tougher stances towards the disinformation spread by Russian state media. But Russia has also made less of an effort to reach western audiences, reckons Carl Jack Miller of Demos, a think-tank in London.The preponderance of Ukraine-friendly messages on Western users\u2019 news-feeds hardly means the information war is over. \u201cThe narrative that Ukraine has won the information war is complacent and not necessarily backed up by anything empirical,\u201d Mr Miller argues. Independent researchers say that social networks\u2019 unwillingness to share data makes it difficult to assess how information is spreading online. That is especially true of organic content, and of newer platforms, in particular TikTok. \u201cThere is no systemic, reliable way to look across these platforms and see what the information ecosystems look like,\u201d laments Brandon Silverman, co-founder of CrowdTangle, a social analytics tool.Inside Russia, Mr Putin has kept a tight grip on the narrative by tightening the flow of information. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have all been banned; users on TikTok cannot create new content. Wartime censorship laws make calling the war a war punishable by up to 15 years behind bars. Russian authorities have created Telegram chatbots for citizens to inform on those spreading \u201cincorrect information\u201d.Russian disinformation campaigns seem to be targeting Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, crafting messages that tap into pre-existing anti-Western or anti-American sentiments, says Mr Miller. A team at Demos used semantic analysis of accounts pushing pro-Putin hashtags on Twitter and found a preponderance of activity in South Africa and India. Public opinion on the conflict in Asia is not as definitively anti-Russian as in the West. Cyril Ramphosa, South Africa\u2019s president, recently tweeted that \u201cthe war could have been avoided if NATO had heeded the warnings\u201d about its eastward expansion.As the physical war settles into a bloody grind of attrition, so will the one for attention online. Westerners \u201clike the stories about tractors and tanks, but not the stories about pregnant women suffering\u201d, Ms Tsybulska sighs. \u201cTractors and tanks are entertainment, but if you acknowledge the suffering, we all have to do something.\u201d Photographs did not bring about an end to war by making suffering visible, as some hoped they would in the 19th century; neither will social images now. Yet they will continue to be taken, posted and shared. As Ukraine demonstrates, real life is increasingly lived online, both at peace and at war.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/international/the-invasion-of-ukraine-is-not-the-first-social-media-war-but-it-is-the-most-viral/21808456", "date_modified": "2022-03-31T14:26:24Z", "date_published": "2022-04-02T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/03/articles/main/20220326_eup508_1.jpg"},
{"title": "One killing among many in a Kyiv suburb", "content": "DESPITE a police operation to collect them, corpses were still scattered over Bucha\u2019s streets. The local authorities say that over 300 have been buried in a makeshift mass grave. On April 4th about 30, some in black bags, were still left unburied. A day earlier, reporters had seen bodies, apparently of civilians, littering the roads, up to 20 in one street. As investigators collect , was able to verify reports of what appears to be a .Nine bodies lay at the side of a builder\u2019s yard that had been used as a Russian base, and another two on the road linking Bucha with Irpin, two aspiring suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. All had gunshot wounds to the head, the chest or both. At least two of the victims had their hands tied behind their back. From the sweet, putrid smell of the decomposing bodies, they had been there for some time\u2014giving the lie to Russian claims that the killings were carried out by Ukrainian forces, which liberated Bucha on March 31st. Serhiy Kaplichny, director of the municipal burial service, says he knew one of them. His friend, Andriy Dvornikov, worked as a driver. \u201cHis only crime was not immediately accepting [the Russian World],\u201d he said, fighting back tears. Mr Dvornikov\u2019s common-law wife, Yulia Truba, found out about his apparent execution from pictures of the grisly scene published on Facebook. \u201cI recognised his trousers, his trainers, and his tattoos; and it was his back.\u201d That was on April 1st. The last contact she had with her partner was a phone call four weeks earlier, on March 5th. In hushed tones, he had told her he was in trouble. He\u2019d been caught at a checkpoint when it came under artillery fire. The Russians had encircled them, and he was taking shelter in the basement of a local home along with the seven men manning the checkpoint. One of the men, Vanya Skyba, described what happened next. Russian soldiers found the group later that evening, and hammered down the door of the shelter. They asked if any had fought in the Donbas or were serving soldiers. \u201cWe said no, we were builders. But they moved us to a base on Yablonska street 144. They made us take our clothes off, lie face down, and then they searched our telephones and bodies for symbols and tattoos.\u201dAs an example, to make the group talk, the Russians then killed one of the men\u2014\u201ca short, bespectacled guy from Ivano-Frankivsk,\u201d in Mr Skyba\u2019s words. It worked: one of the rest admitted that he was a member of Ukraine\u2019s territorial defence. Mr Dvornikov, who was no longer a serving soldier, had fought in Donbas in 2015-16. But he had a paratrooper\u2019s tattoo and that would have given away his past. Mr Skyba, speaking to us on April 4th, says that he and the other men were beaten and tortured, and after a few hours an order was issued to kill them. Some of the soldiers had Asian eyes and strong accents, he said, which led him to assume that they were from Buryatia, in eastern Siberia.The execution order was itself issued by a man who spoke with a standard Russian accent. \u201cThe Buryatis asked what they should do with us. The Russian answered that they should \u2018\u2019 us [\u2018fucking do them in\u2019]\u2014but to do it away from the base.\u201d Mr Skyba says that they were led to the side of the building and shot. He took a bullet in the side, but it went through his body. He survived by playing dead on the concrete floor. As soon as he heard there were no voices, he fled over a fence to a nearby home. Some Russian soldiers later found him there, but they were from a different unit, and believed a cover story that he was the owner of the home.Remarkably, they then led him back to a bomb shelter in the cellar of the same base where he had been shot. Mr Skyba stayed there, along with a dozen or so women and children, for a few days before the soldiers released them. He travelled back to Kyiv on March 9th or 10th, when humanitarian corridors opened. Many of those in Bucha say that the Russian soldiers were polite. \u201cSome of them even said sorry,\u201d says one. Military defeat may have changed that. On the road linking Bucha with nearby Irpin, the charred remains of a column of Russian hardware stands to this day, the result of a devastating Ukrainian drone and artillery attack. Vehicle engines and detached tank barrels are visible 10 metres either side of the road. A local resident claims that Russian soldiers were later brought to the scene to inspect the carnage.In the centre of Bucha an elderly woman queuing for food and medicine at the central hospital on Energetykiv Street cries as she remembers the worst of five weeks of Russian occupation. \u201cWe tied white ribbons to our arms so they wouldn\u2019t shoot,\u201d she says.

Many more will be found.The renewed evidence of Russian atrocities has produced renewed condemnation. \u201cGenocide\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s president and Poland\u2019s prime minister called it. The American president, Joe Biden, said what had happened in  was a war crime and that , Russia\u2019s president, should face an international tribunal for it. The  secretary general asked for another investigation (several are already under way), and Ukraine said it would set one up with the . The former  chief prosecutor for war crimes in Yugoslavia and Rwanda demanded that an international arrest warrant be issued against Mr Putin. For its part, Russia said the whole thing was faked, then blamed the Ukrainians for it, demanding a  Security Council meeting to discuss the \u201cheinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals in Bucha\u201d. It is possible there were or will be atrocities by Ukrainian forces, though not on the same scale. But Ukraine will, presumably, investigate them, unlike Russia. In this particular case, the decomposition of the victims\u2019 bodies shows they had been killed long before Ukrainian forces recaptured Bucha.The evidence from the battlefield confirms that Russians have committed at least three types of criminal offence in war. The first are war crimes. The Geneva Conventions, which Russia has signed, define war crimes to include wilful killing, wilfully causing great suffering, deliberately targeting civilians and destroying or appropriating property. Summary executions at Bucha would be war crimes. So would the which was the city\u2019s largest air-raid shelter and had the Russian word for children written in letters large enough to be seen from the sky. The Geneva Conventions determine what are international legal obligations in all military actions. It does not matter that Russia has not formally declared war in Ukraine.Second, Russia\u2019s invasion was itself a crime, regardless of the way in which it has been carried out. It is a crime of aggression. This is spelled out in the statutes of the International Criminal Court (), which tries individuals for actions under international law. The  defines aggression to include invasion, military occupation, the annexation of land, bombardment, the blockade of ports and other actions that contradict the UN charter. Lastly, the scale of the Russian actions around Kyiv (and elsewhere) strongly suggests that Russia is guilty of crimes against humanity. The  defines this as participation in and knowledge of \u201ca widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population\u201d. Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed and over 4m driven abroad.Proceedings have begun in several international courts to bring the perpetrators to justice. Two have made initial rulings in Ukraine\u2019s favour. In the first, on March 16th, the International Court of Justice (), which adjudicates on inter-state disputes, ruled that Russia \u201cshall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced\u201d on February 24th. The issue before the court seemed arcane: Ukraine said Russia\u2019s argument that it had launched an invasion to prevent a Ukrainian genocide in Russian-speaking breakaway regions was bogus under the \u2019s genocide convention. The significance of the ruling was not just that the court agreed with Ukraine, but that it broadened its conclusion to demand Russia\u2019s full withdrawal.The other ruling came at the European Court of Human Rights, which is part of the Council of Europe, a governmental human-rights body. On April 1st it confirmed an earlier ruling that Russia must \u201crefrain from military attacks against civilians and civilian objects, including\u2026schools and hospitals.\u201d Ukraine had brought the case under European human-rights laws. The court added that Russia had acted wrongly when it forced refugees from Mariupol to flee to Russia, rather than to a place of their own choosing.But it is one thing to make rulings, another to bring to an international court any Russian, let alone its . Russia was thrown out of the Council of Europe on March 16th because of the invasion and has stopped responding to the European court\u2019s demands. Since 2016, the country has not recognised the authority of the , either. That does not rule out the  prosecutor bringing a case or issuing arrest warrants against individual Russians. But if Russia ignores the warrant, the next step would be to refer the case to the  Security Council - and Russia could then use its veto. Russia does accept the authority of the other international court, the , at least in theory. In practice, though, it did not show up at the court\u2019s hearings and (obviously) has ignored its ruling. As with the , the only way of enforcing  rulings is through the  Security Council. If Mr Putin remains in power, therefore, or even if he resigns but continues to be protected by successors, international justice will not be seen to be done.Legal proceedings will grind on and are likely to deal further setbacks to Russia\u2019s legal case and diplomatic standing. Meanwhile, Ukraine\u2019s allies will have to find other means of stepping up pressure on Mr Putin. These include more sanctions and more lethal weapons to Ukraine.Even before the horrors revealed by Russia\u2019s retreat from Kyiv,  allies had started to offer heavier weapons. The  reported on April 1st that the Biden administration planned to transfer Soviet-made T-72 tanks to bolster Ukrainian forces in the Donbas region. These would be the first tanks provided to Ukraine by America, which had previously insisted its military aid was purely defensive. On March 16th Britain started to provide the Ukrainians with its advanced Starstreak anti-aircraft missile; on April 1st a video showed a Starstreak apparently bringing down a Russian helicopter. Other advanced weaponry seems likely to be on offer soon. So is , the fifth in all.Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, made up of heads of government of  countries, says more sanctions are \u201con their way\u201d. They will include easy ones, such as closing loopholes, imposing more restrictions on individual oligarchs, banning Russian ships from  ports and more fully isolating Russian banks cut off from the  international payments system. But this time the  could also include embargoes on energy supplies, something long  but resisted by gas-importing  states. The defence minister of Germany, Europe\u2019s largest gas buyer, called for the  to discuss . France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, went further and said he would support banning all Russian oil and coal coming into the , a position also taken by the leader of a junior partner in the Italian government. Like Germany, Italy is dependent on Russian energy. Further energy restrictions are already coming into force: on April 3rd  became the first  country to ban imports of Russian gas. Russia\u2019s war crimes seem to have stiffened resolve among Ukraine\u2019s Western allies. They seem to be saying, in the words of Antony Blinken, America\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cWe can\u2019t become numb to this. We can\u2019t normalise this.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/international/2022/04/04/how-if-at-all-might-russia-be-punished-for-its-war-crimes-in-ukraine", "date_modified": "2022-04-12T16:04:38Z", "date_published": "2022-04-04T20:52:23Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220409_BLP504.jpg"},
{"title": "Are labour markets in the rich world too tight?", "content": "LAST MONTH Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, identified the most uncomfortable trade-off in economics. \u201cToday\u2019s labour market\u201d, he said at a press conference, is \u201ctight to an unhealthy level\u201d. In most places and at most times a fall in unemployment, or a rise in the number of people in work, is welcome. But labour markets can become too strained, creating worker shortages that stop production and cause wages to spiral, which can feed into overall inflation. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, identified the most uncomfortable trade-off in economics. \u201cToday\u2019s labour market\u201d, he said at a press conference, is \u201ctight to an unhealthy level\u201d. In most places and at most times a fall in unemployment, or a rise in the number of people in work, is welcome. But labour markets can become too strained, creating worker shortages that stop production and cause wages to spiral, which can feed into overall inflation.Mr Powell fears that America has crossed the threshold from good-tight to bad-tight, one reason why the Fed is signalling that higher interest rates are on the way. Increasingly, though, labour markets elsewhere in the rich world are also straining at the seams.Almost nobody saw this coming. When the pandemic struck in 2020, most economists believed that the rich world was in for a long spell of high unemployment, similar to what happened after the financial crisis of 2007-09. In April 2020 America\u2019s unemployment rate hit 14.7%. Had joblessness declined at its post-financial-crisis pace, the unemployment rate in March this year would have been over 13%.In fact, it is 3.6%. And America, by many standards, is a laggard. A rise in the number of Americans who have decided they do not want to work at all, and who therefore do not count as unemployed, means that the share of 15-to-64-year-olds with a job is slightly below its level at the end of 2019 (see chart 1). In one-third of rich countries, however, this share is at an all-time high. Even among the other two-thirds, which includes America, the median shortfall in the employment rate is just one percentage point. It adds up to the quickest and broadest-based jobs boom in history.Canada and Germany are among the countries with record employment rates. The same is true of France, known for its high joblessness. The working-age employment rate in Greece is three percentage points above its level in 2019. Across the  group of mostly rich countries there are about 20m more jobs than had been forecast in June 2020. The number of unemployed people chasing unfilled vacancies is the lowest it has been in decades (see chart 2). Even as pricey energy and rising interest rates provoke concern about the economy, there is little sign from \u201creal-time\u201d indicators that demand for labour is dropping.Why is the jobs recovery so fast? One reason is the nature of the shock that hit the economy in 2020. History shows that financial crunches\u2014tight monetary policy, banking disasters and so on\u2014cause prolonged pain. But economies usually recover speedily from \u201creal\u201d disruptions such as natural disasters, wars and, in this case, a pandemic. In 2005 Louisiana\u2019s unemployment rate soared after Hurricane Katrina but quickly fell back (though part of the adjustment came from people moving away). After the second world war European labour markets rapidly absorbed soldiers returning from the front lines.Government policy has also boosted jobs. In 2020 countries including Australia, Britain, France and Germany launched or expanded job-protection or furlough schemes. At the peak over a fifth of European workers remained technically employed even as they twiddled their thumbs. When lockdowns lifted, they could quickly return to their roles\u2014rather than having to search and apply for work, which takes time and thus keeps unemployment elevated. America launched a modest job-protection scheme, but its efforts were largely targeted at maintaining peoples\u2019 incomes via stimulus cheques and topped-up unemployment benefits.Stimulus schemes shored up families\u2019 finances. Many households also reined in spending in 2020, allowing them to accumulate huge savings. The stockpile is now being spent on everything from consumer goods to housing, raising demand for workers in areas such as online retail and property services (including an extra 200,000 estate agents in America).With labour demand so strong, employers are having not only to increase the number of jobs but also to improve their quality. Amazon exaggerated when, last year, it said it would try to be \u201cEarth\u2019s best employer\u201d, but many other companies are promising similar things, whether by offering employees better in-office benefits (such as tastier cafeteria food) or better compensation packages (free college tuition). In 2021 venture investors put more than $12bn into global  tech startups, roughly 3.6 times the capital invested in them in 2020, according to PitchBook, a data provider.Bad employers are having a tough time. The share of Americans worried about poor job security is near a historical low. In Britain the share of full-time workers on a \u201czero-hours contract\u201d, where there are no guaranteed hours, soared after the financial crisis but is now falling. Many of the gig-economy firms that grew in the early 2010s by relying on an army of underemployed workers are struggling to find staff. Whether in London, Paris or San Francisco, hailing a ride is harder than it used to be.The best measure of labour-market tightness is pay, which distils the relative bargaining power of workers and firms into a single number. In some places the situation is clearly getting out of hand. Wheeler County, Nebraska, is a heavily agricultural place a long way from anywhere. In December unemployment fell to around 0.5%. Jobs at a nearby Chipotle Mexican Grill pay $15-16.50 an hour, at least twice the federal minimum. Some firms claim to be raising wages by 30% or more.Some countries still look decidedly un-Nebraskan. Japanese wage growth is easing, not accelerating. In December the \u201cspecial wage\u201d, which includes winter bonuses and typically makes up about half of total cash wages in that month, fell by 1% year on year. German wage growth is doing nothing special. Canada\u2019s is respectable but it is hard to make the case that things are out of control.On average, however, labour markets across the rich world are clearly getting tighter. America\u2019s is plainly overheating. In March average hourly earnings were 5.6% higher than a year earlier, on the headline measure. Another gauge suggests that the lowest-paid are seeing bigger rises (see chart 3). Goldman Sachs, a bank, produces a wage tracker that corrects for various pandemic-related distortions. It is more than 5% higher than a year ago, the fastest rate of increase since the data began in the 1980s. Almost all wage measures in America show unusually rapid growth (by comparison, manufacturing wages rose by an annual average of 4.1% in 1960-2019).Before the pandemic, underlying French wage growth was in the region of 1-2% a year. Now it is close to 3%. Italy looks similar. On March 23rd Norway\u2019s central bank noted that \u201cwage inflation has been higher than projected, and wage expectations have risen.\u201d Britain is particularly striking. On Goldman\u2019s measure, underlying pay there is rising at an annual rate of about 5%. Surveys of businesses suggest that even faster growth over the coming year cannot be ruled out. Across the 10 large economies as a whole wages are rising by at least 4% a year.Is this sustainable? To most people wage growth of 4% hardly sounds malign. But the arithmetic is inescapable. At 4% wage growth, labour productivity (ie, the value of what workers produce per hour) must grow by at least 2% a year in order to be consistent with an inflation target of 2%. Businesses would pass on half their extra hourly wage costs to customers in the form of higher prices, but would absorb the other half since they would be selling more goods and services, or producing them more efficiently.Productivity growth of 2% a year is not unachievable, but it would be a lot stronger than it was before the pandemic. Although productivity growth does seem faster than normal, our analysis of data from  countries suggests that it falls short of 2%. It may yet rise as companies reap the gains from their large investments in remote-working technologies and digitisation. Hopes of higher productivity, however, must be weighed against fears of still-higher wage growth.If heady wage growth cannot be sustained, how might it fall? One long-floated possibility in those countries with lagging overall employment rates is that people who have left the workforce return, boosting the supply of labour. Fear of covid-19 might eventually fade and child care might become easier to find, easing worker shortages and causing wage growth to fall.This hope is receding, however. Although many Americans have returned to the workforce over the past six months, wage growth has not slowed\u2014in fact, it has accelerated.  calculates that in September there were nearly 1.9m \u201cmissing\u201d workers aged 25 to 54, based on participation rates in January 2020 and adjusting for population growth. By March 2022 this had fallen by more than half to about 750,000\u2014or less than two months\u2019 worth of job growth at the recent pace. There are another 1.3m missing older workers, but most are over 65 and likely to have retired permanently (and the number of missing over-65s has been growing).It is likely, therefore, that in America and elsewhere labour markets will have to be cooled the old-fashioned way: by central banks raising interest rates, making it a little more attractive to save than spend and choking off demand for labour. The Fed has already increased rates by 0.25 percentage points, and is expected to do so by a total of 2.5 points this year. America may prove an example of what happens when policymakers respond to a labour market that has become dangerously hot.

This epiphany led to a new exhibition, \u201cSuperheroes, Orphans and Origins: 125 years in comics\u201d. \u201cOnce you start pulling on this thread,\u201d says Laura Chase, the exhibition\u2019s curator, \u201cit takes you all around the world.\u201d The exhibition includes original artwork and copies of comics from nine countries, including China (Zhang Leping\u2019s \u201cWanderings of Sanmao\u201d), Japan (Keiji Nakazawa\u2019s \u201cBarefoot Gen\u201d), Spain (Carlos Gim\u00e9nez\u2019s \u201cParacuellos\u201d) and Sweden (Lisa Wool-Rim Sjoblom\u2019s \u201cPalimpsest\u201d, pictured below). The oldest object on display is a page of R.F. Outcault\u2019s \u201cHogan\u2019s Alley\u201d, a newspaper strip which introduced a homeless character, the Yellow Kid, in 1895. But the most important place and time for comics about foundlings, orphans, adoptees and foster children was America between the 1920s and the 1940s. Harold Gray\u2019s \u201cLittle Orphan Annie\u201d was released in 1924. \u201cOrphans,\u201d declares Annie in one strip, are \u201ckids with so much on th\u2019 ball that they\u2019re bound to make th\u2019 grade\u2014and why? Because they\u2019ve got to make that grade\u2026on their own!\u201d In Frank King\u2019s long-running \u201cGasoline Alley\u201d, a garage owner, Walt, adopts a boy left on his doorstep in 1921. \u201cYou\u2019ve taught me that I wasn\u2019t even living until you came along and parked on my doorstep,\u201d Walt tells his baby a year later. Dick Tracy took in a boy he called Junior in 1932, and Popeye and Olive Oyl began looking after a foundling nicknamed Swee\u2019Pea in 1933. As well as commenting on the reality of American cities\u2019 slums before federal welfare assistance, this inherently dramatic trope enabled child characters to have dangerous adventures, and adult characters to have children without the need to write in a marriage or a pregnancy.When superhero comics were born shortly afterwards, being an orphan was almost a job requirement. In 1938 Jerry Siegel\u2019s and Joe Shuster\u2019s Superman was orphaned twice: first when his home planet of Krypton blew up, then when his adoptive parents, the Kents, died. That looks like carelessness, as Lady Bracknell said of another foundling, but in later \u201cSuperman\u201d comics, Martha and Jonathan Kent survived well into his adulthood. Next came Bill Finger\u2019s and Bob Kane\u2019s Batman, who first stalked Gotham City in 1939. As his big-screen incarnations remind viewers all too regularly, Bruce Wayne\u2019s parents were murdered, as were those of Robin, The Boy Wonder, who moved into Wayne Manor in 1940. In 1941 Timely Comics followed the trend by introducing the orphaned Captain America and his orphaned sidekick, Bucky Barnes. Years later, Timely Comics would become Marvel Comics, whose most famous characters include Spider-Man (brought up by his uncle and aunt after his parents were killed), The Hulk (brought up by his aunt after his mother was killed and his father was committed to a psychiatric hospital), Wolverine (ran away from home after his father was killed and his mother was committed to a psychiatric hospital), Daredevil (whose single father was killed by gangsters), Black Panther (mother died in childbirth, father murdered). And so on and on. There are obvious narrative benefits to superheroes who are separated from their birth parents. \u201cThey need answers. They need justice. Perhaps they need revenge,\u201d Woodrow Phoenix, a cartoonist, has said. \u201cThere is also another very practical reason for taking support away from a child protagonist. If there are parents, then there is someone to say no.\u201d But for children in the care system, this motif has a deeper resonance. Superheroes are outsiders. They feel different from everyone else. Many, such as the X-Men, forge a new family with other people on society\u2019s fringes. In an essay in the exhibition catalogue, Mr Sissay writes about how close he felt to Superman when he was in a children\u2019s home, and how he later spotted the psychological links between them: \u201cNotice how, as an adult, he does everything to hide his past. Notice how he secretly feels like two people\u2026And notice how difficult he finds relationships.\u201d Superman isn\u2019t sure whether to identify with the Kryptonian parents he never knew or the human parents who brought him up. Until the mid-1980s, his friends usually used his alien name, Kal-El; since then they have called him Clark. It is the kind of shift that adoptees will recognise, and which the comic form allows. The most successful strips run for decades, so there is time for the characters to grow, and for their origin stories to develop. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurtling towards a denouement in comics,\u201d says Ms Chase. \u201cThey just keep going, which reflects our own lives.\u201d The curators argue that youngsters in care can resemble Superman and his peers in other ways, too. \u201cWe know from the work we do with young people in care,\u201d says Ms Howell, \u201cthat what they go through and what is expected of them when they leave care at 18 is preposterous. The resilience they need is superhuman, and they often go on to achieve great things. They really are superheroes.\u201d Picture credits: New York World\u2019s Fair Comics, Vol. 1 #2, Jack Burnley \u00a9 & \u2122 DC Comics. All Rights Reserved. Used with permission.

His father had short white hair and a short white beard, and wore a black polo-neck; his mother had the tidy, demure, kindly air one would expect of a piano teacher. They were both modest and spoke to us in flawless Ukrainian. Clearly they were worried about their son. Smetanin was being held in solitary confinement in a pre-trial detention centre without being able to make or receive phone calls, or write letters. \u201cHe cannot even have his violin with him because it is a suicide risk,\u201d said his father.utsk air base was hit again with Russian missiles two weeks after the first strike, and again the day we left town. An oil depot was targeted the following day. The invasion has united Ukrainians; it has also meant that, in Lutsk, Ilya Smetanin and those connected to him have been vilified. Members of the Wings of Volyn aviation club and the Save Old Lutsk Facebook group have been detained and questioned by the security services.t 4.30am on February 24th, in the opening salvo of war, Russian missiles hit the military airbase at Lutsk, a city in the province of Volyn in western Ukraine. Footage of the aftermath showed wrecked buildings and a burning car. No one died. Several days later, Ukrainian television broadcast a video confession by Ilya Smetanin, a 35-year-old violinist and aviation enthusiast from Lutsk who admitted passing military information to the Russians before the attack. In the video, Smetanin wears a dark sweater and a parka. He looks pale and tired, with shadows under his eyes.Smetanin said he had met a Russian military officer on social media in 2010 and gave him video and photos of flight paths and defensive structures at the airfield. \u201cI admit my guilt,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologise to the Ukrainian people.\u201dBut who was this unremarkable individual? When prompted, his fellow musicians offered a symphony of observations.\u201cHe always wanted to fly. It was his childhood dream to fly\u2026\u201d\u201c...but his parents pressured him to be a musician.\u201d\u201cHe spoke really loudly. He was a big-headed kind of guy.\u201d\u201cHe had his good side. He would always help me carry my things.\u201d\u201cHe was into healthy living. He went to the gym. He didn\u2019t drink and he didn\u2019t smoke.\u201d\u201cHe was handsome. People would ask me to be introduced to him.\u201d\u201cHe never had a girlfriend. He said he had decided he would never get married.\u201d\u201cBut his parents wanted him to get married and have children, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\u201cYou know he was born in 1986, but he had this strong nostalgia for the Soviet Union, even though he had no memory of it. It was very strange.\u201d\u201cSomehow he was the odd one out, because everyone else was looking forward and he was looking backward.\u201d\u201cHis father is Russian.\u201d\u201cHe spoke Russian. He didn\u2019t like Ukraine or Ukrainian culture. He said, \u2018why should I have children so they can suffer in this place?\u2019\u201d\u201cBut he spoke Ukrainian really well.\u201d\u201cHe said he would only have the Russian Sputnik covid vaccine. I heard all the family went to Brest [in Belarus] to get it.\u201d\u201cHe was a big fan of Deep Purple.\u201dWe spent three days in Lutsk talking to Smetanin\u2019s parents, friends, colleagues and former teachers to find out how a violinist from a small city came to be accused of spying.utsk is a city of over 200,000 people, with a 13th-century castle, a military base and Habsburg fa\u00e7ades interspersed with Soviet blocks. It was built in the wide Ukrainian steppe of shifting frontiers, alternately the vassal of Polish kings and grand dukes of Lithuania. It was sacked by the Tartars and annexed by the Russian Empire. During the second world war, around 25,000 Jews from Lutsk were killed in the \u201cholocaust by bullets\u201d, the slaughter that happened following the German invasion of the Soviet Union. After the war, the Polish population was expelled when the town was ceded to the Soviet Union.One Thursday morning, three weeks into the war, the Cantabile Chamber Music Orchestra of the Volyn Regional Philharmonic, where Smetanin once played the violin, was rehearsing for a series of patriotic recordings. Concerts had been cancelled, explained Toviy Rivets, the director, and several of the players had left Ukraine. But the scant dozen who remained felt it their duty to continue as best they could.We sat in the small rehearsal room lined with concert posters and listened as they played a musical score by Myroslav Skoryk, a Ukrainian composer who died in 2020, that has become an unofficial national anthem. It was from \u201cHigh Pass\u201d (1981), a film about a family in the Carpathian mountains during the second world war. The music swelled and soared, the high notes of the violins gave way to the sad sweep of the cellos against the burr of the double bass. The music was deeply melancholic but it contained hope.Smetanin, who was unmarried and lived with his parents, had played with the Cantabile orchestra for several years. His father had taught a number of the violinists. The musicians knew Smetanin more as a colleague than a friend, but they were still shocked by his confession. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t understand it,\u201d said Roman, a double-bassist. Nina, a cellist, lived close to the base. \u201cI was having a cigarette outside when it exploded. Everything shook. My hair turned grey. I don\u2019t know if it was from the bombing the first day or the shock of what Ilya did.\u201dmetanin is the only child of two music teachers: Marina, who teaches the piano to school children, and Igor, who teaches violin at the local music college. \u201cFrom the age of five\u201d, Smetanin told a local reporter in 2015, \u201cmy dad stuck a violin in my face and said, no matter what, you\u2019re going to learn to play.\u201d Most people in western Ukraine speak Ukrainian as their first language; the Smetanins spoke Russian at home and Ilya attended the only Russian-speaking school in Lutsk. An old school friend of his, Vova (not his real name), remembered that Smetanin was young for his class and bullied for being small.In the district where they both grew up, there were a lot of military families who had been posted to the air base during Soviet times.\u201cIlya\u2019s friends were the sons of pilots or former pilots,\u201d his father told me.\u201cWhen he was a child, two or three years old,\u201d his mother remembered, \u201che would always point up at the sky at the planes and follow their flight.\u201d\u201cPerhaps it was in his genes,\u201d said his father. \u201cMy grandfather\u2019s brother, who was killed in the second world war, was a pilot.\u201dSmetanin\u2019s bookshelves were filled with memoirs of pilots and aviation encyclopedias, as well as the work of French writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. His greatest ambition was to be a fighter pilot, but he failed the medical exam \u2013 he had allergies, a heart irregularity and his eyesight was poor. His father said Smetanin was disappointed. Instead, he studied the violin at the Lviv Conservatory. A year after graduating he went to Kyiv and played for several orchestras there, including the National Symphony Orchestra.Vova moved to Kyiv and often met up with Smetanin. \u201cAt the beginning\u201d, Vova remembered, \u201ceverything went well.\u201d Smetanin rented an apartment with a friend who worked as a  (a toastmaster). They topped up their salaries by performing at private events. When the Maidan revolution closed Kyiv down for several months in 2013-14, the concerts stopped and work dried up. Vova said he and Smetanin went to the protests but only to observe the spectacle, not because they were politically engaged. Smetanin attempted to make money as an estate agent and by writing articles for music publications. Neither venture worked out.Smetanin eventually returned to Lutsk. He moved in with his parents and joined the Cantabile Chamber Music Orchestra, which paid a scant $150 a month. He still had connections to the music scene in Kyiv and from time to time he went to play abroad, to Dubai, France and Germany. He told people that everything was fine, but it was obvious that he felt thwarted. His friends were getting married and having families. \u201cWe were waiting for him to grow up,\u201d his father told me.Smetanin returned to his old obsession with aviation. He spent much of his time with retired military men who had been posted to Lutsk during the days of the Soviet Union (the original air base had closed in 2004). They compared Ukraine\u2019s penury and lassitude unfavourably with the old days of rigour and discipline. They rued Ukraine\u2019s relinquishment of its nuclear weapons in the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 and bemoaned the enfeebled state of the Ukrainian army. Smetanin began to echo the old-timers\u2019 frustrations. \u201cBut he was right,\u201d Vova said \u2013 the Ukrainian army had been neglected, in particular by President Viktor Yanukovych, deposed in the Maidan revolution and widely considered a Moscow stooge.Smetanin joined a local aviation club called the Wings of Volyn, made up of civilian pilots who flew gliders and sports planes from a small aerodrome in a village outside Lutsk. He took on the administration of their Facebook page, uploading photographs of old Soviet pilots and planes, and snaps of recent club outings. Vova remembered Smetanin riding around on the same old bicycle he had at school to take pictures of planes. \u201cIt was the funniest thing\u2026At the beginning it was interesting, but after a while we began to laugh  like grow up, you\u2019re still taking pictures of fighter jets?\u201dMore than once, Smetanin went to the annual international  air-show in Moscow \u2013 despite the fact that, after conflict began between Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists in 2014, direct flights to Russia were suspended. Many Ukrainians considered Russia to be enemy territory.After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the Ukrainian Air Force\u2019s 204th Tactical Aviation Brigade was relocated to the newly reopened airbase in Lutsk. Smetanin befriended the pilots and found flats for some of them. He was always helping people, said his parents. He would take presents from his retired military pals to their friends in Russia whenever he visited. When an old pilot died last year, Ilya helped his granddaughter, who came from Russia, sell his apartment.Smetanin\u2019s interest in Soviet-era aviation was seen as reactionary. He joined a Facebook group called Save Old Lutsk that served as a forum for local activism. Participants griped about everything from the overpowering smell of sewage works and inept tree-pruning to new housing developments. Smetanin complained that it was not appropriate to hold a vintage-car rally at the military base \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s like putting a balalaika in the middle of a symphony,\u201d said his father.To many locals, Smetanin seemed to disparage the national pride that had begun to emerge after the Maidan revolution. His friends rolled their eyes, as Ilya\u2019s online presence grew increasingly stubborn, embittered and derogatory. More than one person we spoke to in Lutsk had stopped talking to him.\u201cHe said he wanted to do something good for Lutsk but that no one appreciated him or listened to him,\u201d Vova told us. \u201cHe felt frustrated by everyone. First it was Lutsk then it was all of Ukraine.\u201d The pair fell out. \u201cFor the past couple of years I just phoned him on his birthday.\u201dIn 2018 Ilya joined a small delegation from the Volyn region which took part in the International Forum of Victors in Bryansk, a Russian city near Ukraine\u2019s north-eastern border. The event was styled as a celebration of the \u201c75th anniversary of the liberation from Nazi invaders\u201d. One of the Volyn attendees gave a speech that chimed with the Kremlin\u2019s view and appeared to condemn the Maidan revolution and subsequent election.On their return, many of the delegates were called in for questioning by the , the Ukrainian security service. Then in March 2020, Vitaly Sinelnikov, a former pilot stationed on the Lutsk base, was arrested on the Polish border leaving Ukraine with a memory stick full of aerial photographs of the military site. Sinelnikov had been caught on tape describing the layout and condition of the runway and discussing how best to penetrate the perimeter fence. He was a member of Wings of Volyn and Smetanin had given him some of the photographs he was caught with. The security services interrogated Smetanin and seized his laptop and phone. No charges were brought against him, but he must have known that he would remain under surveillance.e met Smetanin\u2019s parents in a small restaurant in Lutsk. His father had short white hair and a short white beard, and wore a black polo-neck; his mother had the tidy, demure, kindly air one would expect of a piano teacher. They were both modest and spoke to us in flawless Ukrainian. Clearly they were worried about their son. Smetanin was being held in solitary confinement in a pre-trial detention centre without being able to make or receive phone calls, or write letters. \u201cHe cannot even have his violin with him because it is a suicide risk,\u201d said his father.In the days leading up to the war Smetanin had run back and forth to the pharmacy for medication because his parents had both come down with covid-19. We asked which vaccine the family had taken (one of the orchestra members had insisted they received the Russian Sputnik one). \u201cI think it was AstraZeneca,\u201d said Igor.The whole family was woken by the explosions on the base in the early hours of February 24th. \u201cI could hardly understand what was happening,\u201d Smetanin\u2019s father said. \u201cIlya said to me, \u2018This is war.\u2019\u201d Smetanin called his pilot friends, who told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We are all alive. We left several hours ago. We are not at the base.\u201dOn March 1st in the middle of the afternoon, an  investigator and two armed agents came to the family\u2019s apartment. They searched it, removed Smetanin\u2019s phone and laptop and took him away for questioning, telling his parents that he would probably return in a few hours. His parents spent two days searching for him. After a series of frantic phone calls and visits to the , they were finally contacted on the morning of March 3rd by a lawyer. She told them that she had just been appointed to defend Smetanin and that they had only a few hours before the first court appearance to collect character references from his workplace and neighbours.Under the conditions of martial law, imposed by President Volodymyr Zelensky on the first day of the war, Smetanin\u2019s parents were not allowed in the courtroom. They saw him briefly in the corridor outside as he arrived and then again as he left. They had only time to ask him how he was. Smetanin replied \u201cI\u2019m ok!\u201d and smiled, cheered a little by their presence.That evening his confession was aired on . This would have been illegal in ordinary times; under martial law, broadcasting such a video was permitted, a spokesman for the security services told us. His parents thought that the video seemed odd. They noticed a scratch on their son\u2019s forehead. Smetanin was talking more slowly than usual; his father had the impression that he was reading from a script. Smetanin\u2019s lawyer told us she had seen a medical report which indicated that Smetanin had been beaten in custody.The lawyer then recused herself as she was leaving town; a second lawyer was appointed. (We talked to both lawyers, but neither wanted to be identified because of the amount of public outrage surrounding the case.) The new lawyer met Smetanin briefly before a hearing on March 11th, in which a request was made for Smetanin to be put under house arrest pending trial. This was refused on the grounds that he posed an ongoing risk of passing information.His parents were present in the courtroom for this hearing, but Smetanin appeared via a video link. He was still wearing the same clothes he had been arrested in. After the opening formalities, the judge allowed his parents to speak to him for two minutes. Smetanin told them that he was fine, but that they shouldn\u2019t send him so much food.His parents hope that his trial will take place in the next two months, but there is an expectation that it will be delayed because of the war. According to a written statement given to us by the Ukrainian security service, the  has \u201cestablished that the traitor passed information to the enemy special services about the types and number of military aircraft, their locations and training flights, and the personal data of airfield servicemen. From February 24th to 28th, he constantly leaked information about the impact of the Russian invasion on the Volyn region.\u201dSmetanin\u2019s current lawyer has not yet seen the prosecution\u2019s case. When this lawyer asked him why he had made a video confession, Smetanin said that he was in a state of shock and had been put under pressure. He has since refused to admit his guilt on the charge of treason.utsk air base was hit again with Russian missiles two weeks after the first strike, and again the day we left town. An oil depot was targeted the following day. The invasion has united Ukrainians; it has also meant that, in Lutsk, Ilya Smetanin and those connected to him have been vilified. Members of the Wings of Volyn aviation club and the Save Old Lutsk Facebook group have been detained and questioned by the security services.Many of the townsfolk revile the family as Russian-speaking and therefore somehow pro-Russian. But almost all Ukrainians flow back and forth between the two languages. And the Smetanins are not as Russian as some people claim. Igor\u2019s mother\u2019s family is Ukrainian, as is Marina\u2019s on both sides. \u201cIlya is 75% Ukrainian. So it\u2019s ridiculous to say he could have done this,\u201d Igor said. \u201cAll of our relatives are here. We have relatives sitting in shelters in Chernihiv who can\u2019t get out.\u201d As Marina put it, \u201cWhy would we live here for so long if we didn\u2019t want to be here?\u201dPeople have shunned the Smetanins in the street. Marina told us that the university where she works as an accompanist has made it clear to her they would prefer her to leave. Igor\u2019s students have stayed loyal \u2013 he clasped his hands together gratefully \u2013 but he is glad that classes are, at present, online. Both parents still worry that they could lose their jobs. \u201cThe only thing I can do is play the violin,\u201d said Igor. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, just sit at home? My life will have no meaning \u2013 and it\u2019s the same for my wife.\u201dMarina and Igor Smetanin miss their boy. \u201cThere\u2019s no one to scold now,\u201d said his father, sadly. They worry that, even if he is released, his reputation will have been blotted. They sincerely believe in his innocence. They pointed out that there had been an air base in Lutsk since 1941: the Russians hardly needed a spy to point this out. \u201cHis first enemy is the fact that he talks too much,\u201d said Igor. \u201cHe is naive.\u201dInnocent plane spotter, unwitting patsy, traitor. It is hard to judge amid the differing perspectives. Smetanin\u2019s parents maintained he never visited the military base. Vova said he remembered being on the base with him \u2013 but only once and it was eight years ago. Ivan Savych, the editor of the , who knows Smetanin well, told us that \u201cIlya had very good access to the military airfield and close personal contact with officers. He used to go to the command centre and even took me there with him. It\u2019s no secret.\u201dOnly a trial will reveal whether Smetanin betrayed his country. I asked his friends if they thought he had done it: some thought he could have; others demurred. Vova felt sorry for him. \u201cAll of us, those who knew him, who saw the video, we understood that someone knew how to push him and use him. Maybe Ilya just wanted to pretend to be an important person. The video made him look like a grand spy, but all he had was a telephone and an old bicycle.\u201d has reported on post-Soviet Georgia, the Iraq war and the Egyptian revolution.

America and its Western allies had frozen roughly half of the country\u2019s $630bn . Firms such as JPMorgan Chase and MSCI had removed Russian debt from widely tracked bond indices. Investors had begun writing down the value of their assets, which were trading at distressed levels.

Now a default\u2014which would be its first foreign-currency default since 1917\u2014seems all but inevitable. Although Russia\u2019s finance ministry has continued to make payments on its foreign-currency debt, it has only done so thanks to an exemption granted by America\u2019s Treasury Department allowing investors to receive debt payments through American banks until May 25th. On April 4th, in the wake of reported atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, the Treasury said it would start blocking such payments. \u201cThe US Treasury will not permit any dollar debt payments to be made from Russian government accounts at US financial institutions,\u201d a spokesperson said in a news release. \u201cRussia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default.\u201d The news sent CDS spreads soaring once more. According to data provided by IHS Markit, a research firm, the cost of insuring Russia\u2019s government debt for five years hit 4,300 basis points on April 5th, up from 2,800 the day before (see chart). This means it now costs $4.3m to insure $10m of the country\u2019s securities for five years. Russian bond prices, meanwhile, are tumbling. A bond maturing in 2028 is trading at 34 cents on the dollar; another maturing in 2042 is fetching just 28. The size of a default would be relatively small, by historical standards (see chart). The Russian government owes $40bn in foreign-currency debt, of which around half is held by foreign investors. But as Carmen Reinhart, the chief economist of the World Bank, recently pointed out, the exposure of non-bank institutions\u2014such as hedge funds\u2014to Russia is still unknown. Bondholders may struggle to recover their money. As Jay Newman, a former hedge-fund manager, has written, Russia has declined to waive its sovereign immunity from lawsuits, limiting their ability to sue in the event of default. Their only recourse may be to ask courts for permission to seize Russian sovereign assets\u2014such as ships or foreign-exchange \u2014to repay the debts. Not everyone is losing out, however. Some traders are reportedly profiting from the country\u2019s distressed debt. , a financial-news magazine, reports that Barclays, a bank, has made $50m trading the securities. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have reportedly each generated $100m apiece.

To estimate the damage in these areas the researchers relied on rough estimates from town officials.There has been at least $28bn worth of damage to roads. Add in damage to bridges, ports and railways, and the infrastructure bill exceeds $32bn. Some 196 health-care facilities have been destroyed across Ukraine, which will cost another $2bn to rebuild.

Born to a wealthy family in Illinois in 1938, Mr Brand moved to the Bay Area to study biology at Stanford University. He quickly fell in with the Beat poets and, on returning to California after a brief stint in the army, met Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, a troupe of acid-loving hippies. Mr Brand was at the heart of the emerging counterculture. In 1966 he organised the Trips Festival, an experimental, three-day event featuring a performance by the Grateful Dead, then an emerging rock band, and plenty of LSD. It was, as Mr Markoff describes, \u201cthe first time the Bay Area\u2019s ten thousand hippies realised that there were ten thousand hippies.\u201d By bringing free-spirited Californians together, the festival came to symbolise the start of flower power. Mr Brand\u2019s ability to unite individuals and galvanise movements became a hallmark of his career and explains his towering influence on many of the Golden State\u2019s subcultures. The , first published in 1968, became a kind of manifesto for the several thousand Americans building communes. Those who wanted to live self-sufficiently off the land needed access to tools to survive; Mr Brand\u2019s publication provided them. The black-and-white pages packed full of agricultural equipment and how-to diagrams won both America\u2019s National Book Award in 1972 and a cult following, particularly among environmentalists. Meanwhile Mr Brand\u2019s belief in tools as a \u201cdemocratising\u201d force was strengthened, explains Mr Markoff. The man who hung out with Mr Kesey had become a \u201ctechnophile\u201d. Mr Brand, who was also a journalist, mingled with early computer pioneers. He helped Douglas Englebart, an inventor, demonstrate the computer mouse to the world. In 1972 he and Annie Leibovitz, a photographer, documented the engineers of the first modern personal computer at Xerox\u2019s PARC laboratory for  magazine. A few years later Mr Brand became the first journalist to use the phrase \u201cpersonal computer\u201d (by then he had discontinued the amid deepening depression) and went on to found the Hackers Conference in 1984, a pivotal moment for the open-source philosophy responsible for much of modern software.Mr Brand\u2019s technophilia helped shape Silicon Valley. But it drove a wedge between him and his ecologically minded friends. He had always been an outlier, enjoying Ayn Rand\u2019s libertarian books at university. His fascination with humans settling in space\u2014he financed the subject\u2019s first major conference in 1974\u2014widened the divide. In 2009 Mr Brand distanced himself from his fellow environmentalists, advocating for genetically modified organisms and nuclear power. As for the eco-warriors, he labelled them \u201cirrational, anti-scientific and very harmful\u201d. In response George Monbiot, an activist, suggested that Mr Brand was a spokesperson for the fossil-fuel industry. The criticism echoed Mr Kesey\u2019s remark decades earlier: \u201cStewart recognises power. And cleaves to it.\u201d Mr Markoff\u2019s book is dense and often mirrors the \u2019s chaotic structure; it jumps between time periods in a way that, at times, makes it difficult to follow the narrative of Mr Brand\u2019s life. \u201cWe Are As Gods\u201d, a forthcoming documentary about the tech visionary, is sharper. Produced by the publishing division of Stripe, a Silicon Valley payments company, it dwells on Mr Brand\u2019s attempt to build a clock that will last for 10,000 years\u2014an effort to encourage humans to think more deeply about the future\u2014on Jeff Bezos\u2019s vast ranch in Texas. It also explores Mr Brand\u2019s ambitious endeavour to bring mammoths back from extinction by genetically modifying elephants. To Mr Brand, this is a new form of conservation. To his critics, it is hubristic.The documentary\u2019s focus on outlandish projects amplifies the biggest criticism of Mr Brand\u2014that he may be too optimistic about technology and too neglectful of its risks. It derives its title from the \u2019s opening sentence: \u201cWe are as gods and might as well get good at it.\u201d Peter Coyote, a longtime acquaintance of Mr Brand who partied at the Trips Festival decades earlier, offers an alternative characterisation of humanity: \u201cidiot savants\u201d.

Now Russia\u2019s spies are being hammered, too. On April 7th Austria, for many years a hub for Russian espionage, became the latest country to expel suspected Russian intelligence officers, bringing the total number of Russian officials expelled from America and Europe since the war began to more than 400. The mass expulsions, the largest in history, are likely to have lasting effects on Vladimir Putin\u2019s intelligence services and their ability to spy\u2014and to subvert\u2014in Europe.Though America and Bulgaria each kicked out a dozen Russians in the first week of the war, the most recent round of expulsions began with Slovakia and Bulgaria in mid-March, followed by Poland and the Baltic states on March 23rd, and then a cavalcade of others, including 75 from France and Germany on April 4th. On April 5th nine countries, and the European Union itself, sent home more than 150. Most are alleged spies, though not all\u2014Lithuania is casting out Russia\u2019s ambassador. Other countries are preparing further expulsions.The ejection of spooks on this scale is unprecedented. It is more than double the number booted out in 2018, when 28 Western countries expelled 153 suspected spies in response to Russia\u2019s attempted assassination of , a former Russian intelligence officer who had spied for Britain, in Salisbury, England. The latest expulsions are \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201clong overdue\u201d, says Marc Polymeropoulos, who led the CIA\u2019s operations in Europe and Eurasia until 2019. \u201cEurope was their historic playground and their diplomatic staff is always pretty damn large in a lot of these places.\u201d In his last job, says Mr Polymeropoulos, \u201cwe really considered Europe to be a key battleground with the Russians.\u201dThe immediate aim of the expulsions is to punish Russia for its . Officials from the FSB, Russia\u2019s security service, and GRU, the military intelligence outfit that targeted Mr Skripal, both played a key role in planning and waging the war. It is also intended to make it harder for Russia to go about the core business of intelligence: stealing secrets.The Russian intelligence presence in some European countries had grown so large that it was becoming hard for local security services to keep tabs on suspected and proven spies. Last year a German spy chief said that Russian spying stood at the same levels as during the cold war. Before the most recent expulsions, there were estimated to be almost 1,000 undeclared Russian intelligence officers in embassies and consulates in Europe.But espionage is not the only concern. Rooting out intelligence officers also helps insulate Europe from Russian sabotage and subversion. In one way, the roots of the latest expulsions stretch back to last year. In April 2021 the Czech Republic accused the GRU of bombing an arms depot in the country. It expelled 81 Russian diplomats (one reason why it has kicked out fewer this time round), America another ten and other European countries 14.That episode, and others like it, prompted a sweeping NATO audit of Russia\u2019s (stations, as Britain or America would call them) in Western embassies and their activities. The audit found that the country\u2019s embassies were packed with huge numbers of undeclared intelligence officers from across its three services: the GRU, FSB and SVR, Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, which makes up the bulk of spies in diplomatic missions abroad. In October last year NATO expelled eight alleged spies from its mission in Brussels, prompting Russia to shut down the office and to kick NATO out of Moscow in return. The purpose of removing Russian officials from Europe is not just to stop them doing undesirable things. It is also to stop them aiding and abetting others. The GRU officers who poisoned Mr Skripal and bombed Bulgaria were not pretending to be diplomats in London or Sofia; they were sent from Moscow under what is known as non-official cover. Mr Skripal\u2019s would-be assassins famously pretended to be tourists visiting Salisbury cathedral. Such covert action often relies on support from local embassies, though, such as the use of diplomatic pouches to move illicit material across borders. Making this sort of thing harder is sensible, but it comes at a cost because Russia responds in kind. After the Skripal expulsions, Russia kicked out 189 Western officials. One result is that bona fide diplomats\u2014who are invariably part of the exodus\u2014have less opportunity to engage ordinary Russians, at a time when state propaganda is growing more unhinged. This is why foreign ministries are often less keen on expulsions than security officials. The number of Western spies in Moscow also takes a hit. In practice, this may be less of a problem than it seems. On their home turf, Russian security services have more resources and powers at their disposal to track Western intelligence officers based in embassies in Moscow than vice versa\u2014a GRU officer can move around and meet people more easily in Berlin than a CIA officer in Russia\u2019s capital. Nor is expulsion a permanent solution. Russia tends to send back new spies to replace the ones who have left, requiring Western counterintelligence agencies to work out, from scratch, which lowly first secretary is the new spook. Some Western officials say their aim is to ensure that bloated Russian embassies in Europe are no larger than their Western equivalents in Moscow\u2014a principle that the Czech Republic insisted on last year. That requires constantly refusing visas for new arrivals, and diligent information sharing among allies so that an officer kicked out from one country cannot be sent to another.Fewer Russian spies in New York, London or Paris means fewer potential double agents. Nonetheless, there are still plenty left. And Western spies may find good hunting among them in the current circumstances. It was the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 which disillusioned Oleg Kalugin, a KGB general, Oleg Gordievsky, the KGB\u2019s  in London and Vasili Mitrokhin, a KGB archivist; the latter two became spectacularly successful agents for MI6, while Mr Kalugin became a dissident and moved to America. The war in Ukraine, far bloodier than the crushing of the Prague Spring, may have a similar effect on some of their successors in the GRU, SVR and FSB.\u201cMany of those serving here fully realise that Russia has been humiliated by this disastrous war because of their total access to information,\u201d says Jonathan Haslam, a historian of Russia\u2019s intelligence services, \u201cand you can conclude that on their return to the Motherland they cannot be relied upon by the regime.\u201d In Moscow, the upper echelons of the FSB seem to be in turmoil, blamed by Mr Putin for botching the war and providing unreliable information. Russian spies posted abroad, and their families, will also have become accustomed to life in Western capitals. A return to  may not appeal. \u201cI would hope that all of them are getting a phone call or a bump on the street or a visit from the local security services for a chat,\u201d says Mr Polymeropoulos. \u201cThe allies should hit them up before they leave.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/07/russian-spooks-are-being-kicked-out-of-europe-en-masse", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T17:08:52Z", "date_published": "2022-04-07T11:09:11Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220409_BLP509.jpg"},
{"title": "Britain has entered a third phase of post-war immigration", "content": "LAST MAY Raymond Padilla, a former journalist from the Philippines who arrived in Britain in 2005, was elected to Gloucester City Council. Filipino reporters called his victory historic; it also seemed improbable. Gloucester, in the west of England, is not hugely diverse. At the time of the most recent published census, in 2011, only 14% of its inhabitants were anything other than white and British. The city does not even have a Filipino restaurant.

Filipino reporters called his victory historic; it also seemed improbable. Gloucester, in the west of England, is not hugely diverse. At the time of the most recent published census, in 2011, only 14% of its inhabitants were anything other than white and British. The city does not even have a Filipino restaurant. When immigrants want a taste of home, they make do with Thai food.But the number of Filipinos in Gloucester is growing. That is largely because of its hospital, where Mr Padilla works as a nurse. \u201cWe\u2019re all over the place because hospitals and care homes are all over the place,\u201d he says. And that growth hints at a profound change in the pattern of immigration to Britain.Since the second world war Britain has gone through two big phases of immigration. First came migrants from former colonies such as India, Pakistan and Jamaica, who often availed themselves of free movement within the empire and Commonwealth, just as the British colonists had done. As the Sri Lankan writer and activist Ambalavaner Sivanandan put it: \u201cWe are here because you were there.\u201dThen came a European phase. In 2004 Britain was one of only three  countries to open its labour market to citizens of the Baltic and eastern European countries that had just joined the bloc. In the two decades to 2020-21 the European-born population in Britain rose from 1.5m to 3.9m, and from 35% to 41% of the foreign-born population, according to the Labour Force Survey.The European phase ended in December 2020 when Britain enacted a new, post-Brexit immigration system. Free movement to and from continental Europe ceased. But Boris Johnson\u2019s government made work permits easier to obtain.Companies no longer had to prove that they had tried to hire a native Briton for a role, and the salary threshold that skilled migrants are required to clear was lowered from \u00a330,000 ($39,000) to \u00a325,600. For health-care workers the threshold is even lower, at a mere \u00a320,480. In another change, foreign students in British universities are now allowed to work for at least two years after graduating, restoring a right that they had held under the previous Labour government.Sixteen months into the new regime, the consequences are clear. Despite the many disruptions of covid-19, Britain is issuing more work and study visas (see chart). The vast majority are not going to Europeans. In 2021 people from India received almost 99,000 study visas, up from a low point of 16,000 in 2015. Nigerians were granted 10,000 skilled-worker visas and 43,000 study visas\u2014about as many as in the previous four years put together.Filipinos received almost 10,000 skilled-worker visas, putting them in third place behind Indians and Nigerians. The country has become an essential source of nurses (the picture shows a training session in Manila). In the six months to September 2021, fully 3,040 Philippines-trained nurses joined the National Health Service. That is more than the number of new  nurses trained in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales put together. Britain\u2019s covid-19 vaccination drive began in December 2020 when a Filipina matron, May Parsons, injected Margaret Keenan.Britain\u2019s third phase of immigration looks in some ways like the first, post-imperial phase. As well as Indians and Nigerians, Britain is issuing more skilled-worker visas to people from Kenya, Pakistan and Zimbabwe\u2014all former British territories. But the rising number of visas going to Filipinos and others with scant historical ties to Britain, such as Brazilians, reveals the difference. If the first phase of immigration was post-imperial, and the second European, this one is global and middle-class. Britain smiles on nurses, coders and students from everywhere, and on fruit-pickers from nowhere (although they are eligible for temporary-worker visas).Filipinos are likely to keep moving to Britain, at least for a few years. The government has pledged to hire 50,000 nurses by 2024, points out Billy Palmer of the Nuffield Trust, a health-care think-tank, and \u201cwe\u2019re not going to get it from our domestic supply.\u201d An American economist, Michael Clemens, has shown that emigration from a country tends to rise until it reaches a level of income equivalent to about $10,000 per person at purchasing-power parity, before declining. The Philippines happens to be near the peak of the curve.Another reason to think it will continue is that Britons, who showed their dislike of free movement from Europe by voting to leave the , seem happier with the focus on skilled immigrants. Polling by Ipsos  shows that the proportion who want to see immigration reduced fell from 67% to 42% between February 2015 and February 2022. Three-quarters of Britons favour letting immigrants take health-care jobs (asylum-seekers coming across the Channel are less popular; see Bagehot).A bigger problem in the next few years might be attracting enough skilled immigrants. Real wages have stagnated and sterling is weak, reducing the value of remittances. And now that Britain is trying to recruit the global middle class, it is up against other rich, English-speaking countries. \u201cAustralia, Canada and Britain are all trying to compete for those skilled workers,\u201d says Kate Hooper of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, . So is America, when politics allows.In Gloucester, Mr Padilla is doing his bit\u2014and not only by helping new immigrants settle. Sometimes when he rings a British customer-service helpline he is put through to a call centre in the Philippines. Recognising the accent, he switches to speaking Tagalog. At the end of a call, the call-centre worker tends to ask: so, is life better in Britain? He tells them it is.

Conservative s have attacked Priti Patel, the home secretary, for failing to let people in, rather than for failing to keep them out. Scepticism about refugees has melted among the British public. Support for resettling Ukrainian refugees in Britain (at 76%) rivals the approval ratings for the queen.Moral panics, when people demand an authoritarian crackdown against the villain of the hour, are common in British politics. Less noticed but just as frequent is the inverse. Call it an ethical spasm. For a brief moment, newspapers, s and voters combine to demand a more liberal, generous approach from the government. Moral panics tend to leave a mark. The statute book is littered with knee-jerk but permanent laws on everything from dangerous dogs to paedophiles. Unlike their authoritarian cousin, ethical spasms rarely leave a trace. Once the moment passes, the state turns nasty again.When it comes to Ukrainian refugees, the Home Office can be forgiven for not predicting the latest twitch. Cruelty is a feature of Britain\u2019s asylum system, not a bug. Welcoming refugees is a reversal of previous policy. Indeed, the department has spent the past year coming up with schemes of near comic-book villainy to deter migrants from crossing the Channel. These plans have ranged from wave machines to processing arrivals on St Helena, an island in the South Atlantic. (A deal to process asylum-seekers in Rwanda is now being mooted.) An engine built to reject people has suddenly been told to accept people, akin to slamming a car into reverse while speeding along a motorway.Yet at the same time that the government is attempting to remove obstacles for Ukrainians, it is planning to make them higher for others. The Nationality and Borders bill working its way through parliament will make irregular entry into Britain a criminal offence, even if someone is seeking asylum, which is probably illegal under international law. According to one Conservative peer, the proposal is \u201clargely unnecessary\u2026mean-minded and at times approaches the vindictive\u201d. It is nonetheless likely to become law, in this parliamentary session or the next.The asylum system is not the only area where generosity momentarily interrupts a miserly norm. During the pandemic the government increased universal credit, a benefit payment, when it became clear that millions more would end up on it. Rather than expose middle-class voters to the reality of the day-to-day welfare system, the Treasury coughed up an extra \u00a320 ($26) per week\u2014about \u00a31,000 extra per year\u2014to make it more generous.If benefits were too low during a lockdown, when it was practically illegal to spend money on some things, then they are probably too low in normal times. Yet Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, felt comfortable removing the temporary increase. In the spring statement last month, Mr Sunak left those still on working-age benefits with a real-terms cut. A plurality of British voters support higher benefits. But Conservative voters tend to want them to be the same or lower. Mr Sunak declined to ramp up benefits for the same reason he opted not to seize the means of production: it is not what Conservative chancellors do.A recent backlash against brutal policing followed a similar pattern. In 2021 footage of police breaking up a vigil in memory of Sarah Everard, a 33-year-old raped and murdered by an off-duty police officer, triggered outrage. A similar outcry occurred in 2010 during student protests, when truncheon met middle-class student\u2019s skull and the often rough-and-ready tactics of the British police were revealed to a new audience. Yet rather than guaranteeing the right to protest, the government is making it easier for police to arrest demonstrators for vague reasons such as being noisy. The British public\u2019s views on crime and punishment are Old Testament. A politician who promises draconian policing will receive more votes than one who promises a liberal approach.There are two explanations why ethical spasms rarely last. The charitable one comes down to ignorance. For most people in Britain, the state is kind. People come into contact with the parts of it that are still just about adequately funded, such as schools and the health-care system. Meanwhile the state pension, a benefit that most people enjoy eventually, has become more generous.The state is predominantly nasty only to an unfortunate minority. The bulk of Britons are born there and so have little contact with the immigration system. Dealings with police are limited to asking for directions, rather than being thrown headfirst into a van. Most people have jobs and no experience of a harsh benefits system. Once a topic passes out of the public\u2019s eye, it is forgotten.Another explanation is less forgiving, but more likely. Voters would rather have a nasty state than a nanny state. The two most popular governments of the past few decades\u2014Labour under Tony Blair and the Conservatives under Boris Johnson\u2014have had an authoritarian bent. Hammering protesters and cracking down on asylum-seekers has been a potent mix.Cruelty is a choice, not a state of nature. But it is a choice voters seem to prefer. A more generous welfare system would result in higher taxes, which Britons are loth to pay for anything other than health care. Politicians with a bias towards kicking people out are more attractive than those who want to let people in. Bluntly, the state is nasty because voters have asked for it to be. The welcome mat has been rolled out for Ukrainians fleeing war. But it will be rolled up again soon enough.

Fintech startups have spent recent years reviving point-of-sale lending, now dubbed . Business is booming. Klarna, the largest provider by market share, started offering  to British consumers in 2016 and now counts nearly a third of the adult population as customers. Citizens Advice estimates that one in 12 Britons used  loans in the second half of 2021 to buy essential goods such as food and toiletries.The evidence that  itself causes financial distress is limited. But it can encourage people to spend more than they otherwise might. And, notes Peter Tutton of StepChange, a debt charity, it is frequently used by those who are already struggling. In the year to October 2021, one in three  borrowers had either made a late payment or missed one altogether; of those, 56% had been refused a credit card.That was before the cost of living started to rise in earnest. The energy price cap, which limits suppliers\u2019 default tariffs, rose by 12% last October. On April 1st it jumped by a whopping 54%. It could spike again by a similar amount in the autumn. Food-price inflation is also rising. In the last six months of 2021 food prices were 1.5% higher than for the same period the previous year. Over the next two months, they rose by a further 3.7%. On April 6th a rise in national insurance, a payroll tax, took effect.It is all going to add up, predicts the Office for Budget Responsibility, to the biggest drop in real household disposable incomes in any tax year since records began in 1956. Running down savings, scrimping more and wearing extra jumpers can all help. But taking out credit is another way to cover the bills. Sure enough, net credit-card borrowing in February was \u00a31.5bn\u2014higher in real terms than in any month since March 2004 (see chart).Straitened times have a habit of encouraging unsustainable borrowing. The years that followed the financial crisis of 2007-09 saw a boom in payday lending, with firms selling high-cost loans to people who couldn\u2019t pay them back. In 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority () took over regulation of consumer credit. Four years later Wonga, then Britain\u2019s biggest payday lender, collapsed into administration amid plummeting sales and a surge in compensation claims for mis-selling.For Stella Creasy, a Labour , the parallels with today\u2019s  lenders are uncomfortable. \u201cThey\u2019re doing exactly the same thing payday lenders did: it\u2019s getting people into the habit of using debt,\u201d she says. And regulation is proceeding \u201cat a snail\u2019s pace\u201d, despite an  review identifying an urgent need for it in 2021. (A legal loophole designed to make invoicing easier means that  loans are unregulated as long as they are time-limited and interest-free.) Results from a Treasury consultation are expected \u201cin the spring\u201d, after which the  is likely to solicit yet more input.

{"title": "Making deliveries via the Thames", "content": "ON A RECENT Thursday morning, the stretch of the Thames that wends through central London is largely deserted, save for the odd river bus or barge moving in with the tide, carrying empty containers to be filled with rubbish. It\u2019s a far cry from the glory days of the 19th and 20th centuries, when ships moored at the city\u2019s Royal Docks, once the largest in the world. Thursday morning, the stretch of the Thames that wends through central London is largely deserted, save for the odd river bus or barge moving in with the tide, carrying empty containers to be filled with rubbish. It\u2019s a far cry from the glory days of the 19th and 20th centuries, when ships moored at the city\u2019s Royal Docks, once the largest in the world.In the post-war years, new container vessels became too big for London\u2019s Victorian-era docks. Deliveries moved east; the city\u2019s last dock closed in 1981. It is now generally cheaper to transport goods to their final destination by road than by river. Cheaper, but not greener. As firms seek to cut emissions, some wonder if the Thames might be an answer.Londoners have 700m parcels delivered each year, but the lorries and vans that carry those packages snarl up traffic and pump out fumes and carbon. The Port of London Authority (), which wants to increase river traffic, says that barges carrying heavy freight emit less than half as much carbon as the five or so lorries it takes to haul an equivalent amount of goods. Vans are even more carbon-intensive because they take relatively few goods for the amount of emissions they spew.Hence rising interest in the river. Since September 2020, , a delivery firm, has delivered 50,000 parcels via the Thames in a pilot scheme designed to cut down on carbon emissions. Electric trucks carry parcels from Heathrow airport to Wandsworth pier. The packages are then ferried to Bankside pier, before couriers take them to their final destination by bike.Tideway, the firm managing the Thames Tideway Tunnel, a colossal project to upgrade London\u2019s Victorian-era sewer system, brought most of its materials to its 21 riverside sites in barges. The most construction-heavy phase of the project required about 140,000 lorry trips, less than a third of what would have been needed without using the river.Whether big carbon savings will flow from greater use of the Thames is unclear, however. The Tideway Tunnel is a one-off project, and the motivation for using the river was largely to do with safety. Parcel delivery currently costs five times more by river than by road, estimates , a consultancy. Tides and topography put natural limits on the river\u2019s capacity. How comparatively green the Thames stays depends on how easily firms can cut emissions from other modes of transport.More river use will also require more infrastructure, in particular wharves and piers. The  must retrofit pedestrian piers in the city for parcel unloading, and hold on to those wharves that still exist to store heavy freight. A big increase in commercial traffic would mean tussles with residents and developers, who pay a hefty premium to be close to the water.Even so, the Thames is set to become busier. The \u2019s goal is for 20m parcels to be delivered annually; scaling up would make river delivery more cost-competitive. Firms want to be seen to cut emissions:  has recently expanded its pilot scheme. Worsening congestion on London\u2019s roads may also shift the calculus, especially for time-sensitive deliveries. The river will never regain its status as a dominant commercial artery, but the tide is gently running its way again.

The publicly owned channel emerged from the pandemic with a record operating surplus. Frothy shows like \u201cThe Great British Bake-Off\u201d are a hit with viewers, while serious ones like \u201cIt\u2019s a Sin\u201d impress critics.Instead the broadcaster is fighting for its life. One threat comes from America, whose deep-pocketed streaming services are snatching Channel 4\u2019s young audience. The other is from the government, which on April 4th announced plans to sell the channel. Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, said private ownership would enable Channel 4 to compete with Netflix and others. Sceptics, including many Tory backbenchers, see it as an attempt to put the liberal-leaning channel in its place.The worldwide \u201cstreaming wars\u201d have sparked a mania for mergers. Last month Amazon bought  for $8.5bn. Discovery\u2019s $43bn acquisition of WarnerMedia is about to close. But Channel 4 is a tricky target. Online-only streamers like Netflix, Amazon or Apple have no interest in a legacy broadcast network. Discovery, which already does business in Britain, has its hands full with the Warner deal and a separate plan to buy  Sport.Paramount, another American giant, may be interested. It already owns Britain\u2019s Channel 5, so has experience of its complex national broadcasting rules. By filling a third or more of Channel 4\u2019s schedule with content from its American archive it could save up to \u00a3150m ($195m) a year, estimates Matti Littunen of Bernstein, a broker. Yet if the government imagines Channel 4 competing with foreign streamers, it may not want it to be swallowed by one.If the aim is to create a national champion,  might fit the bill. Combining Channel 4 with Britain\u2019s oldest and largest commercial network would create \u201ca gorilla as big as the \u201d, says Claire Enders, a media analyst. But its heft would alert trustbusters.  and Channel 4 together control over 70% of Britain\u2019s  advertising market. Getting the nod would mean persuading regulators that the relevant market was all video ads, including online ones. French authorities are considering just such a case with the proposed merger of 1 and 6. Their decision, expected by the autumn, may inform British thinking.The problem for all bidders is uncertainty. Channel 4 must follow quotas for airing news and buying content from particular regions and from independent production companies\u2014which, unusually, keep the rights to their content. The government has not said which of these rules will remain. \u201cEvery percentage point of content that has to be made out of London, or through independent producers, or whatever other provision is determined, probably takes\u2026something off any offer price,\u201d says one potential buyer. Analysts expect bids of \u00a3500m-1.5bn, depending on what strings are attached.The government says the proceeds would go to creative industries. But production companies prefer the deal they have. Meanwhile, relaxing obligations to make programmes in the regions would jar with the government\u2019s \u201clevelling up\u201d agenda. Some Tories also fear losing distinctively British content. Channel 4 shows like \u201cDerry Girls\u201d are aimed at British audiences, in contrast to series like \u201cBridgerton\u201d, Netflix\u2019s gleefully ahistorical Georgian romp. And whereas some households dislike paying for the , Channel 4 makes its money through ads (something Ms Dorries seemed surprised to discover at a parliamentary hearing last November).Privatising Channel 4 was not in the Tory manifesto, so the House of Lords, where the government lacks a majority, faces no pressure to wave it through. Even if it passes, the tender process and potential competition inquiry would probably stretch beyond the next election, due by the end of 2024. Few senior Tories seem to share Boris Johnson\u2019s enthusiasm for off loading Channel 4; Labour describes it as \u201ccultural vandalism\u201d. Plans to privatise the broadcaster have been floated, and sunk, throughout its life. This one may yet go the same way, says Ms Enders. \u201cYou can\u2019t find a banker in the City that hasn\u2019t wasted time on a Channel 4 privatisation.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/2022/04/07/who-might-buy-britains-channel-4", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T12:14:16Z", "date_published": "2022-04-07T14:40:01Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_brp501.jpg"},

She later added that the South Korean army would \u201cface a miserable fate little short of total destruction and ruin\u201d if it were to attack.The colourful exchange comes at a time of rising tensions. For over four years the North has refrained from testing nuclear weapons or the intercontinental ballistic missiles (s) needed to deliver them to America\u2019s shores, supposedly because the weapons\u2019 development had been completed. Now both programmes appear to be coming out of hibernation.In late February and early March North Korea conducted two big rocket launches which it claimed were to test reconnaissance satellite equipment. American spooks suspected those launches were laying the groundwork for future weapons tests. Then on March 24th something went up that both sides agreed was an . North Korea said it was a Hwasong-17, a previously untested missile larger than anything in its arsenal. It backed up this claim with footage of the launch, which paid homage to 1980s action movies. In it a leather-jacketed Mr Kim taps his watch, dramatically tears his sunglasses from his face and nods gravely, as if signalling the start of the action. The launch itself is filmed from several angles.America and South Korea said the video was doctored. The launch, they said, was probably of the smaller Hwasong-15, which has already been tested. That is plausible. North Korea has faked missile-test footage before. Colin Zwirko, an analyst at  News, a Seoul-based outlet, thinks the regime may have been trying to make up for a launch that failed on March 16th. Which ever missile it was, North Korea\u2019s self-imposed moratorium on  testing is over.More worrying still is the prospect that nuclear tests will soon follow. Satellite imagery shows new activity around one of the tunnels at Punggye-ri, North Korea\u2019s only known nuclear-testing facility, which Mr Kim shut down in 2018. Analysts believe that testing could resume by mid-April.That would coincide nicely with the 110th anniversary, on April 15th, of the birth of Kim Il Sung: Mr Kim\u2019s grandfather and the founder of North Korea\u2019s hereditary dictatorship. A large military parade is planned. Mr Kim likes to celebrate big occasions with a bang. Every nuclear test conducted during his reign has fallen within a week of his birthday, his father\u2019s birthday or the anniversary of the country\u2019s founding.Domestic worries may be one reason for the renewed activity. Everyday life for ordinary North Koreans has become notably grimmer since the start of the pandemic. Mr Kim sealed the country\u2019s borders, causing severe food shortages and battering the informal markets that provide many locals with a living. Mr Kim might be hoping that tests and martial pageantry will bring a little cheer. If indeed the regime did doctor the footage of the latest launch, the intended audience may well have been viewers at home.But Mr Kim doubtless also wants to improve his military capabilities and thus his leverage in negotiations with adversaries, with the eventual goal of being accepted as a nuclear power. Though he has already shown that he can send s skyward, he has yet to prove that the missiles can deliver a payload to their targets. He may also be trying to develop low-yield nuclear weapons. Such devices could sit on shorter-ranged missiles aimed at the South, and help further Mr Kim\u2019s ambition to fire multiple warheads from a single .Mr Suh\u2019s term ends in May, along with that of his boss Moon Jae-in, South Korea\u2019s current president, who tried to win over Mr Kim. The incoming president, Yoon Suk-yeol, takes a harder line. He repeatedly endorsed the idea of pre-emptive strikes on the campaign trail.

A  member, it backs Ukraine and continues to sell it armed drones, which have turned scores of Russian tanks into scrap. Yet President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s criticism of Russian atrocities has been mild. And, more worrying, there are signs that Turkey may be circumventing sanctions against Russia.On March 26th Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, said Russian oligarchs\u2019 business was welcome in Turkey as long as they respected inter national law.

But Mr Erdogan\u2019s habit of provoking the West and placating Russia has taken a toll. A recent poll found 73% of Turks want their country to stay neutral over Ukraine. Only 34% say Russia is responsible for the war: 48% blame America and .

Above all, as the government\u2019s chief legal adviser, they must act as an internal check on the government, and be ready to say \u201cno\u201d to the prime minister.Critics of Suella Braverman, the incumbent, think she is failing in this balancing act, and allowing her political instincts to cloud her legal judgment. But accompanying claims that Ms Braverman is out of her depth are far too dismissive. She is a leading exponent of a constitutional doctrine which has become a hallmark of Boris Johnson\u2019s government.Ms Braverman, who was appointed in 2020, shrugs off criticism that she has politicised her role. She isn\u2019t an unelected technocrat, she notes, and her predecessors in the Labour governments of the 1960s and 1970s were open about the job\u2019s partisan nature. But she does have tabloid instincts: not for her the submarine-like silence that some attorneys general adopt.She has appeared in person to ask the appeal court to lengthen the \u201cunduly lenient\u201d sentences handed to a series of high-profile killers. In January, when a jury acquitted four protesters who had toppled a statue of a slave owner, she said she would ask judges to review the law. She declared her support for Mr Johnson and a former aide, Dominic Cummings, when both were accused of busting covid-19 lockdown rules. Since her role includes oversight of the Crown Prosecution Service, many lawyers thought it would have been better to say nothing.Critics put this down to an unfortunate combination of inexperience and careerism. Appointed to the role at the age of 39, she was the youngest attorney-general since 1802, according to James Hand of the University of Portsmouth. With only a decade at the Bar and not yet a Queen\u2019s Counsel, she was more junior than all but one of her predecessors since 1900. Attorneys-general have historically shunned other ministerial roles; Ms Braverman made her name as a hard-line Brexit minister and has a shot at higher office. This, some think, makes her unsuited to the grave decisions that land on her desk, such as signing off on drone strikes. \u201cI feel rather sorry for her,\u201d says one Tory colleague, considering the pressures of the job.Her supporters note that all attorneys-general rely on external counsel, and detect the condescension that meets many women in the law. And Ms Braverman is a more meaningful figure than her critics allow. Along with many Tory s and several conservative legal academics, she thinks the judiciary has become overmighty in the past two decades. She is a driving force behind a doctrine which seeks to \u201crebalance\u201d the constitution, and which reasserts the ability of politicians to make policy without being gainsaid by judges.In 2020 Mr Johnson proposed breaking his  exit-treaty obligations in order to strengthen his negotiating position, prompting the resignation of Jonathan Jones, the head of the government legal department, and Lord Keen, the advocate-general for Scotland. Ms Braverman provided legal advice justifying the breach of international law on the bald grounds that a sovereign parliament can legislate as it pleases. \u201cShe was determined that a legal way would be found to introduce those clauses,\u201d says a former colleague.In a recent speech she argued that the Supreme Court had wrongly strayed into political terrain when it overturned Mr Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament in 2019. \u201cThe authority of the judiciary must never again be pitched against the authority of the people,\u201d she said. A good many legal academics are alarmed by what they see as the government weakening long-established checks and balances. But as far as Ms Braverman goes, best not to mistake inexperience for incoherence.

In one station I visited, people were sleeping inside a train.Looking back, the atmosphere in those early days was surprisingly cheerful. Life underground was organised precisely: platforms were divided into sections for different families, everything was kept clean and even the pets were well-behaved. People found ways to occupy themselves. I met a young girl making tote bags: one of them said \u201cRussian War Ship, Go Fuck Yourself\u201d, the battle cry of the Ukrainians. On the same visit, I saw a woman reading to a group of spellbound children.Many fled the capital. Initially I spent a lot of time at the railway station. There were hundreds there, mostly women and children, carrying pets and suitcases. I took a photo of a young mother waving goodbye to her husband as he stood on the platform. As the train doors closed, the woman broke down in tears. Her husband watched as the train pulled out. He told me he was just happy that his wife and child were going to be safe.People from Kyiv\u2019s suburbs tried desperately to reach the station. In early March I photographed civilians fleeing from Irpin and Bucha. To slow the Russian advance the Ukrainians had blown up a bridge over the river which divided these towns from Kyiv, so people had to cross it on wooden planks. They were incredibly calm, though it was a difficult journey with the constant risk of Russian shelling. I saw one man with a prosthetic leg climb along the side of the bombed-out bridge rather than use the makeshift walkway. I tried to help him onto the bank once he reached the other side; he collapsed right in front of me. Moments later, he got up and carried on. One woman I met was hoping to cross the river with her 91-year-old father, who had fought in the second world war.Near the bridge the group of journalists I was with came across three men tied to a post with clingfilm. Their trousers had been pulled down around their ankles and their mouths stuffed with potatoes. It was bizarre, although the locals didn\u2019t seem shocked. They told us that these men were Ukrainians who had been stealing from refugees and looting empty houses.You get used to seeing weird things in war. On March 13th Russian forces struck a large apartment block in Kyiv. The international press descended, and it soon seemed as though everybody in the city was standing outside the smouldering building. On the ground I saw a hamster cage, covered in shards of glass. The hamster had survived.One man standing by the wreckage seemed devastated. He looked up at the building and wept. \u201cWhy?\u201d I heard him say. \u201cWhy is this happening? This makes no sense. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d Others looked up for a moment before carrying on with their days, as if this were nothing new. Events that would have been totally mind-blowing only a short time before were starting to feel ordinary.When there\u2019s an attack in Kyiv, squads of volunteers clean up the scene. Mostly this means picking up shattered glass. I took photographs of one team who tidied up a school after it had been hit. The window frames and doors were damaged, and the pink carpet in one classroom was covered in glass, but the tiles on the wall of the entrance hall, which depicted a rabbit, remained intact. Some of the children\u2019s school books were still open. A few women cried as they swept away the glass, but they managed to get the place spotless in a few hours. It takes enormous strength of character to pick through the remnants of buildings and homes that you knew so well.I met another volunteer who had been a marketing manager before the war. Now he\u2019s helping manage a morgue. He told me that nobody can do the job for more than two days at a time, because it is so distressing. I spoke to him at around midday: he had already processed ten bodies that morning. photographed many men and women on their way to the front line and the very real possibility of death. Some of them had fought in the Donbas in east Ukraine, where a conflict has been going on since 2014. Others had no military experience. There was a huge range of emotion: nerves, seriousness, jollity.A few weeks into the war I went to an army base where there was a nun called Sister Elizabeth who ministered to the soldiers, offering them rosary beads and words of comfort. With her was a priest, Father Toma, who blessed the fighters before they headed out to fight. During the blessing, everyone was sombre, though I assume the soldiers welcomed it \u2013 they will take whatever help they can get.In early March, I went to the funeral of a new recruit. His unit appeared to have been ambushed by Russian saboteurs posing as Ukrainian soldiers. It was a small, lonely affair \u2013 maybe half a dozen soldiers, as well as the recruit\u2019s wife and a couple of other relatives. The ceremony was brisk: Russian forces had shelled the cemetery the previous day and everyone was scared there would be another attack. The mourners were surrounded by shards of broken gravestones. Even the dead cannot escape this war.On March 25th, I had an abrupt change of scenery. Together with three journalists from I was whisked through dark corridors to the war room of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. I\u2019ve met a lot of leaders over the years, but the only time I remember admiring one this much was when I photographed Nelson Mandela. Zelensky\u2019s charisma and authenticity lit up the room. I could tell the responsibility was taking a toll on him. But like so many of the Ukrainians I\u2019ve met, he seemed to possess exceptional resilience.

{"title": "Finland is hurtling towards NATO membership", "content": "Finland, after two grinding wars with the Soviet Union, and unlike most of eastern Europe, kept its independence and democracy through the cold war. The price of doing so was neutrality. Finland bought arms from both East and West, but stayed out of alliances. That arrangement, and the way in which Soviet pressure distorted Finland\u2019s domestic politics, became known by the pejorative term . When the USSR was dissolved, Finland, along with Sweden, took the leap of joining the European Union, binding it closer to other European countries. And after Russia\u2019s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, both countries intensified joint exercises and other forms of co-operation with NATO.Russia\u2019s attack on Ukraine has now tipped the scales. When your correspondent visited Helsinki in February, a week before the invasion, official after official emphasised the conservatism of Finnish policy. \u201cWe\u2019re still far from a national consensus,\u201d said one, adding that it was unclear whether support for a NATO bid would gather steam. \u201cDo we just have a national awakening?\u201d he mused. In fact, that is largely what has happened.In 2019 just over half of Finns were opposed to NATO membership. On February 28th, four days after the invasion, the polls showed majority support for the first time. The latest, on March 30th, revealed 61% in favour, 16% against and 23% undecided. That includes majorities among supporters of all parties, except the Left Alliance. And it is widely accepted that if Sauli Niinisto, Finland\u2019s popular president, were to give his formal endorsement, support would grow further. Both Ms Marin and Niinisto are keeping silent for now, to allow a political process to play out. \u201cApril, May and June are important\u2014and in many ways historic\u2014months in Finland,\u201d says Henri Vanhanen, a foreign-policy expert and adviser to the centre-right Kokoomus party. A government report setting out the changes in Finland\u2019s security position since the Russian invasion is due to be published on April 14th.Parliament will then debate the issue. After that, a second government report could make a formal recommendation on NATO membership. A special parliamentary monitoring group, made up of party leaders and committee chairs, will play a key role in signalling the political consensus. A committee of government ministers and Mr Niinisto will take their cue from that. The final call remains with parliament, though whether it will need a two-thirds majority depends on its constitutional committee.A decision is widely expected to come before a NATO summit in Madrid on June 29th, and perhaps as soon as early May. The two main governing parties, Ms Marin\u2019s Social Democrats and the Centre party, have previously been split on NATO. But a consensus is forming rapidly: of 200 lawmakers, 96 are now in favour of membership and just 14 against, according to Helsingin Sanomat, a newspaper. \u201cIt's been the Finnish people in the lead,\u201d says Elina Valtonen, an MP and vice-chair of Kokoomus, whose pro-NATO position has driven it to unprecedented popularity in the polls (elections are due by next April). \u201cI'm pretty confident that we will be filing the membership agreement\u2026in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d adds Ms Valtonen. For Finland, which shuns dramatic change, that is lightning-fast. One reason for that is concern about the country\u2019s vulnerability during a membership bid. On March 12th Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said that Finnish membership would have \u201cserious military and political consequences\u201d, including \u201cretaliatory measures\u201d. Hints of those may already be appearing. On April 8th a Russian plane reportedly violated Finnish airspace, and the websites of the country\u2019s foreign and defence ministries were hit by crude cyber-attacks (which may have been related to a speech by Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president, to Finland\u2019s parliament on the same day). To limit opportunities for Russian meddling, Mr Niinisto has said that a national referendum on NATO will not be necessary.Once a bid goes in, Finland would be especially vulnerable: subject to Russia\u2019s ire, but not yet covered by NATO\u2019s Article Five mutual-defence clause. One answer to that is to move fast. On April 3rd Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary-general, said that Finnish or Swedish accession could be done \u201cin a relatively quick way\u201d. No one, not even Viktor Orban\u2019s pro-Putin government in Hungary, is expected to veto it. Mr Stoltenberg has also hinted at interim security guarantees. He was \u201ccertain\u201d, he said on April 6th, that \u201cwe will find ways to address concerns\u2026regarding the period between the potential application, and the final ratification.\u201d In practice integrating either country would not be hard. Both are as close to NATO as it is possible for a non-member to be. Mr Vanhanen says that NATO officials have told him that Finland is in fact more \u201cNATO interoperable\u201d\u2014capable of conducting joint operations alongside other allies\u2014than some actual members. A special procedure designed in 2014 and activated for the first time after Russia\u2019s invasion means that Finnish and Swedish envoys now sit at the North Atlantic Council, the alliance\u2019s decision-making body, for every meeting relating to the crisis. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Mr Stoltenberg\u2019s predecessor, has said that an application \u201ccould be approved more or less overnight\u201d, though some officials say that is a slight exaggeration.Yet in Sweden, the debate is moving more slowly. Sweden\u2019s main governing party, the Social Democrats, is opposed to NATO membership. As recently as March 8th Magdalena Andersson, the prime minister, said that a membership bid would \u201cdestabilise the current security situation in Europe\u201d. However, the country has had a parliamentary majority in favour of NATO since December 2020. The latest poll, on April 1st, also showed a majority of the public (51%) in favour for the first time, up from 42% in January; opposition fell from 37% to 27%. General elections are due in September. In the past, Swedes worried that a solo NATO bid would leave Finland dangerously exposed. Now it is Finns who wonder whether Sweden will keep pace. The two countries\u2019 armed forces have become intertwined in recent years. They sent a joint brigade to a NATO exercise in March (an earlier joint Finnish-Swedish air exercise is pictured above). It is natural that Finland is ahead, says Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, given its tangles with Russia: \u201cThey have a tradition of thinking more deeply about security issues than we do, for fairly obvious reasons.\u201d But Mr Bildt is confident that, just as Finland caught up with Sweden when both countries joined the EU in parallel in 1995, Sweden will make up the ground. \u201cFor me, it is inconceivable that we would end up in a situation where the two countries come to different conclusions.\u201dFor most of its history, NATO shared only 196km of border with Russia, in the uppermost fringes of Norway. When Poland joined NATO in 1999 that rose to 428km, thanks to its border with the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. And after the accession of the three Baltic states in 2004, the shared frontier leapt to 1,233km. If Finland takes the plunge in the coming weeks, as it is likely to, the common border will more than double at a stroke (see map).That has implications for both sides. A country that has prized stable relations with Russia for 74 years would face a new and sustained level of threat, as Mr Niinisto warned recently. But Russia, too, would have to reconsider the security of the Gulf of Finland and the strategic ports around Murmansk. The irony is that a war launched by Vladimir Putin ostensibly to keep NATO at bay, in Ukraine, looks set to bring the alliance closer than ever before.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/finland-is-hurtling-towards-nato-membership/21808705", "date_modified": "2022-04-08T17:25:16Z", "date_published": "2022-04-08T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_eup509_2.jpg"},
{"title": "Why Britain should scrap non-dom tax status", "content": "On April 6th, the very same day that the Treasury increased payroll taxes, it emerged that his wife, Akshata Murty, has  (\u201cnon-dom\u201d) tax status. As a non-dom, and in exchange for an annual fee of \u00a330,000 ($39,100), she does not have to pay tax in Britain on income generated abroad. That matters because her foreign assets include a stake in Infosys, a giant Indian IT-services company founded by her father, which generated dividends worth a reported \u00a311.6m for her last year. If Ms Murty had been registered as a UK resident, 38.1% of those earnings would have been due to the government department her husband runs. As it is, zilch.Mr Sunak is aggrieved by the focus on Ms Murty\u2019s finances. Wrongly so. He alleges a smear campaign, but it is an odd sort of smear when the principal facts are not in dispute. Mr Sunak\u2019s argument that his wife\u2019s income is her business would make more sense if the government did not treat marriage as a financial merger, in which assets can be transferred between spouses tax-free. To imply that it is sexist to think differently would hold up better if non-dom status were not so archaic: the exemption itself is a legacy of empire and even now a person\u2019s \u201cdomicile of origin\u201d is still largely determined by paternal lineage. To say that Ms Murty has done all that Britain asks of her in terms of her tax affairs is deeply disingenuous when he is the person in charge of what is being asked.On April 8th Ms Murty volunteered to pay British income tax on her global income, without giving up her non-dom status. But the right thing for the chancellor to do is to scrap non-dom status altogether. There is no natural law of taxation which requires it. The non-dom category layers further complexity onto an already-intricate system. The government\u2019s guidance note on how to determine where someone is domiciled features four baffling flow charts and lots of advice to get advice.The fear that getting rid of non-dom status would discourage talented foreigners from coming to or staying in Britain is not to be dismissed: at the margins, it will deter some people. But the country\u2019s attractions (or more specifically the south-east\u2019s, where the country\u2019s 76,000 non-doms tend to cluster) are not restricted to tax breaks: schools, culture and property rights are all in the mix. And once put down, roots persist. New analysis by academics at the University of Warwick and the London School of Economics suggests that people who have ceased to claim non-dom status do not scarper afterwards.Above all\u2014and especially at a time when living standards in Britain are about to record their steepest drop since records began in the 1950s\u2014it is essential that taxpayers regard taxes as fair. In truth, the tax system is progressive: average tax rates rise with income. But non-dom status is an anomaly; it is overwhelmingly used by the mobile rich. In 2018, 0.3% of those earning less than \u00a3100,000 had claimed the exemption; that figure jumps to 41% for those earning \u00a35m and above (among migrants, it zooms to 84%). And since non-doms do not have to tell British authorities where they pay tax on their foreign assets, overseas income can be channelled to tax havens instead. There is no suggestion or evidence that Ms Murty has done anything illegal. But her husband should stop complaining and get rid of the exemption.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/leaders/why-britain-should-scrap-non-dom-tax-status/21808704", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T08:15:23Z", "date_published": "2022-04-08T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_blp514.jpg"},

Bad news, then, for Democrats, who face record prices at the pump ahead of mid-term elections in November. Republicans are blaming the increase on President Joe Biden\u2019s climate policies.A full tank still costs far less than in Europe, but motorists now spend an average of $1.30 more a gallon than this time last year, according to the American Automobile Association. A recent poll by Emerson College finds that 39% blame Mr Biden\u2019s administration, against 21% who fault sanctions on Russia and 18% who say oil and gas firms are responsible.In some states, higher prices have long been the norm for other reasons too. A gallon of petrol in California cost $5.80 as of April 7th, the most expensive of any state\u2014but that is a distinction that it has long held, owing to the hefty environmental taxes the state levies.Unfortunately for Mr Biden, swing states including Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania have some of America\u2019s next-highest petrol costs. In Nevada a Republican advertising campaign pins the blame on the state\u2019s Democratic senator, Catherine Cortez Masto, and her party. The price of petrol in the state has risen by 55% from a year ago, to $5.20 a gallon. In Arizona, where a Democratic senator, Mark Kelly, is vulnerable, prices are up by 50%.Mr Biden has tapped reserves to release 1m barrels of oil a day for six months; national prices have fallen marginally in the past three weeks.

{"title": "A legal defeat could end Imran Khan\u2019s innings as prime minister of Pakistan", "content": "FOUR DAYS of  in Pakistan have ended with legal defeat for the prime minister, Imran Khan. The former cricket star has fooled countless batsmen with fast-paced balls that swung deceptively in the air. But his latest political trick has not fooled the Supreme Court. Faced with a no-confidence vote in parliament, he claimed to be the victim of an American conspiracy to eject him from office. The deputy speaker of parliament, a close ally, cancelled the vote on April 3rd. Mr Khan dissolved parliament and called for fresh elections. No doubt he hoped that voters would rally round a patriot bullied by a superpower. But there is no evidence whatsoever of an American plot. The opposition cried foul, accusing Mr Khan of violating the constitution to cling to power. They appealed to the Supreme Court as the final umpire. Five judges, led by the chief justice, ruled on April 7th that the deputy speaker was wrong to cancel the no-confidence vote, and ordered parliament to reconvene. All actions taken were \u201cof no legal effect and quashed\u201d, the court said. \u201cThe national assembly was at all times, and continues to remain, in session.\u201d Parliamentarians will meet on April 9th so that the vote can proceed.The opposition were elated. , the brother of Mr Khan\u2019s predecessor and the man most likely to take over as prime minister if the cricketer is dismissed, said the supreme court had \u201csaved Pakistan\u201d. \u201cDemocracy is the best revenge!\u201d, added Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, chairman of the Pakistan People\u2019s Party.The parliamentary arithmetic looks bad for Mr Khan. His majority has never been big and he has relied on smaller coalition partners. Some members of his own Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party have defected; some of his allies have abandoned him. His government is blamed for an economy that has been battered by covid-19 and mismanagement. GDP per person fell from $1,500 in 2018 to $1,200 in 2020, and inflation in the year to March was a painful 13%. Perhaps more importantly General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the chief of the army staff, apparently no longer supports him, and without the army\u2019s support Pakistani prime ministers seldom last long. His opponents believe they have more than the 172 votes needed to oust him in the 342-seat house. A new government would probably be a broad coalition led by Mr Sharif.As for Mr Khan, nearly four years after he swept to power on a platform of piety and graft-busting, a return to opposition looms. As a cricketer, he broke records, captaining the team that won the world cup for Pakistan. But he seems unlikely to buck the most daunting statistic in Pakistani politics: no prime minister has ever completed a full five-year term. Still, after the ruling he said he would \u201ccontinue to fight for Pakistan till the last ball\u201d.Whoever wins this tussle will have to deal with the fallout, which will be tough. The deadlock seemed to accelerate a financial slide. The rupee on April 7th reached a record low of 189 on the interbank rate and 191 in the open market, having fallen 6% in a month. Markets have been spooked by the political uncertainty. An IMF loan facility may be delayed until a new government is picked. The central bank raised interest rates by 250 basis points at an emergency meeting on April 7th, saying it was worried about rising inflation and falling reserves.\u201cAfter its euphoria subsides, and assuming it wins the no-confidence vote, the current opposition won\u2019t have it easy,\u201d says Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Centre, an American think-tank. \u201cIt will face an economic mess and it will be hounded relentlessly by an angry PTI in opposition.\u201d Victory may unite the opposition for a while, but its coalition will probably be fragile. Meanwhile, Mr Khan\u2019s fans are furious. Many believe he really was the victim of a conspiracy. Pakistan\u2019s political turbulence is not over.

While the other volunteers around him were posing for photos, swapping arrival stories and drinking beer, he\u2019d refrained. eavy-set and garrulous, David King stood out from the other foreign volunteers at the Cicada Hotel in Korczowa, a town on the Polish-Ukrainian border. Wearing camouflage fatigues, he was sipping from a bottle of beer and smoking a cigarette, waiting for a bus that would take him 30km east to the Ukrainian foreign legion barracks at Yavoriv in western Ukraine.In early March, King closed his bank accounts in Louisiana, cancelled his credit cards and mobile-phone plan, sold his phone and truck and bought a one-way ticket to Warsaw. King is a Christian \u2013 he told me so within minutes of us meeting \u2013 and, on the face of it, he just wanted to help. Photos of ragged women and children \u201cbroke his heart\u201d. Zelensky\u2019s call for volunteers \u201cwas like nothing I\u2019d ever heard before \u2013 a foreign leader asking the world for help like that\u201d. When he arrived in Ukraine, King was moved by the sight of miles of refugees, and by the pets some left behind. He sent me photos of stray dogs \u201caimlessly roaming the streets looking for their humans\u201d.But King\u2019s motivation for wanting to help Ukrainians went beyond humanitarianism. He\u2019s convinced that Putin\u2019s invasion marks the beginning of a greater global plot by Russia, Iran and Turkey to overrun Israel. This scheme was foreshadowed in the Bible, he claims: a passage in Ezekiel 38 portends an epic conflict sparked by a man called Gog (Vladimir Putin, in King\u2019s reading) from a land called Magog (Russia) which will mark the end of days. He has other eccentric theories. Who was responsible for 9/11? It was an inside-job. Fluoride in the American public water system? A government ploy to stop you remembering your dreams. The American corporate elite? Secretly controlled by a cult in India. King harvested some of these views from YouTube pastors and provocateurs; others are of his own making. All of them contributed to feelings of disillusionment and isolation that ultimately pushed him to Ukraine.y his own admission, David King wasn\u2019t always \u201cthis crazy\u201d. He used to think about the world much as others did. Born in 1981 in a small town in Colorado, at 16 he became a father. A year later, like two uncles before him, he joined the armed forces, serving in the US Air Force for a paycheque more than anything else. By 1999 he was married with two kids and a third on the way, and had pivoted to the army. King liked the army\u2019s sense of discipline and patriotism. After 9/11 he wrote a poem called \u201cMy Brothers\u201d that was published in the : \u201cIt\u2019d make you tear up if I found you a copy\u201d. The highlight of his time in the forces was learning to fly helicopters. When he talks about this, his eyes light up and his Midwestern drawl becomes bouncier. \u201cThe helicopter is the most complicated machine ever invented by man,\u201d he likes to say. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a fucking badass pilot.\u201d But almost as soon as he\u2019d got his pilot\u2019s licence, King had to leave the army. In 2004 he divorced his wife, who, King says, was deemed incapable of looking after their three children, meaning that he was awarded sole custody. The army didn\u2019t make it easy to be a pilot and a single parent: King says he was effectively forced out. As he left his base in Alabama, he recalls looking into the sky and seeing helicopters whirring above him. It was a painful feeling, like \u201cwatching another man rail your wife\u201d. King drifted for several years. Searching for flying jobs, he found a promising opportunity at a company called \u201cPilot\u201d in Florida. The name was misleading: the vacancy was for a general manager at an interstate truck stop. King thought he might as well take the job, which involved overseeing a petrol station and a few restaurants. Despite a shaky start (\u201cI didn\u2019t even know the difference between gross and net [profit]\u201d), King worked there for four years before leaving to manage a bunch of hardware stores across Florida and the Midwest.Though his career was stable, his personal life continued to unravel. He\u2019d married again, to a woman he met online, but their relationship collapsed: \u201cI came to believe she wanted me dead,\u201d says King. He started spending more time online and went down internet rabbit holes, \u201cseeking the truth\u201d about who really controlled America. Knowing \u201csecrets\u201d gave him confidence at a time when he felt powerless in his personal life.Then he found the chance to fly again. In the late 2010s, King worked in Afghanistan as a commercial pilot, carrying everything from troops to post to ammunition. He liked the work and it paid well. But going to Afghanistan was \u201cdisheartening\u201d: after more than a decade of liberation from Taliban rule, the Afghans were still selling their children into slavery, \u201cburning goat shit\u201d to stay warm, baking bricks for pitiful wages and getting lung cancer in their teens. The war, he decided, was a gigantic financial boondoggle: Afghanistan had never posed a threat to American national security (\u201cYou really believe that three guys in a cave pulled off the greatest attack in military history?\u201d). He reckoned the occupation was helping no one but American companies like the one he worked for. By the time he came back from Afghanistan, King says he was at \u201cthe point of suicidal depression\u201d. He fell deeper into the conspiracy vortex, looking for answers about how the world was run. King is self-deprecating about his beliefs; he knows most are weird, some downright offensive. He says he\u2019s even tried to dislodge some of them himself, \u201cbut there were always facts in the way to support what I was being told\u201d. Take the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, he says: chief executives and politicians really did hang out with a billionaire sex trafficker.As King\u2019s disdain for globalisation and elites intensified, so, he says, did his wife\u2019s contempt for him. Desperate to get away, he went to Louisiana to fly medical helicopters. He was \u201cliving out of a bag\u201d, staying in hotel rooms. Then King had something of an epiphany: not only was his marriage probably over, his theories had become \u201ctoo fantastical\u201d, and had driven most of his friends and family away. King realised it was time to close a dark chapter of his life, though he wasn\u2019t sure what was coming next. Early in the new year, he embarked on an eight-week road trip across the West Coast in his pickup, sleeping in a tent, seeing old friends, his son and, for the first time, his granddaughter.It was then that events in Europe caught his attention. King, who for all his self-deprecation clearly finds comfort in his \u201ccrazy\u201d theories, may like to cite Ezekiel 38 as his reason for going to Ukraine. But I suspect, deep down, that it was simpler than that. The war, he admits, offered him an escape: the chance at long last to find a \u201ccause worth fighting, and maybe even dying, for\u201d. he most striking thing about King is the way he speaks about military matters. As he outlines his approach to combat, he seems thoughtful, reasonable, careful. He says he wants to know about his enemy before he confronts it. How many are there? What\u2019s their equipment like? What\u2019s the best way to take their position \u2013 and what do we do from there? In Ukraine, David King encountered what he calls an \u201coperational morass\u201d. He had flown thousands of miles to help, but there was virtually no order to anything he saw when he got there. When he arrived at the base at Yavoriv, he found it odd that the Ukrainians had no apparent command structure. He asked a colonel for a pair of socks; the colonel claimed he didn\u2019t have the authority to hand them out. \u201cThe titles that they have \u2013 colonel, lieutenant colonel, major \u2013 seem to be just for pay,\u201d he says. On King\u2019s second day in Yavoriv, he and dozens of other foreign fighters were told that they would be bussed to Kyiv to sabotage Russian supply lines. It struck King as a good strategy so he took it upon himself \u2013 as someone with both managerial and military experience \u2013 to start building teams. He organised the foreigners by their motivation. Were they in Ukraine to make money, to kill Russians or (like him) to help Ukrainians? Then he divided them by their skill sets. Did they know how to work explosives? Were they quick on their feet? Were they skilled with a gun? King surrounded himself with a \u201chigh-speed team\u201d to \u201cgo in slick, hit supply lines, blow up bridges\u201d. There was a former marine from Texas, who he\u2019d met on the train from Warsaw to the border, two Brits who were experts at detonating roads, a French Foreign Legionnaire (\u201cthe gunner\u201d), an American who\u2019d spent time in jail for burglary, three Koreans (\u201cwarriors\u201d). They packed some rifles and ammunition into a bus and headed east for Kyiv. Not long after they left, the barracks at Yavoriv were pulverised by cruise missiles, resulting in dozens of casualties.Approaching Kyiv from the south, King says that it didn\u2019t look like the city he\u2019d seen being bombarded on the news. It was more or less a normal place, save for the plumes of smoke rising from its suburbs. But the mission, it turned out, was \u201ca lie\u201d: there never had been any sabotage work. \u201cAs soon as we got to Kyiv, we were told: \u2018Everyone is infantry.\u2019\u201d They were taken to the ninth floor of a hotel where the power had been cut to prevent it from becoming a target. \u201cThe Ukrainians seemed to have watched a movie somewhere where you need to have \u2018light discipline\u2019,\u201d King says, referring to strategic blackouts to deter air strikes. \u201cBut the rest of the city still had electricity. So we were the only dark anomaly\u2026we stuck out like a sore thumb.\u201d There was a medical facility in the hotel that King believed had been used for liposuction operations; when King and the foreigners from Yavoriv attempted to turn it into an emergency clinic, he claims they were angrily rebuffed.King and others were given bowls of starchy quinoa. Then the Ukrainians started handing them bloodied suits of body armour. \u201cAnd it was like, wait a minute, where are the guys who were once wearing this? Are they still out there, injured?\u201d The foreigners were informed that they were to head to a village north of Kyiv that had recently been overtaken by Russian forces. Their task was to retake it. A Ukrainian commander took out his smartphone and scrolled to the location on a map.King baulked at the idea. How many troops were in the village? What was their armament? How quickly could they be reinforced? Where were their weaknesses? No one seemed to have thought any of it through. \u201cYou don\u2019t just show a picture on your cell phone of a village the Russians had captured and tell 20 guys to go take it,\u201d King says. At that point he got a taxi to Lviv in western Ukraine. From there, he eventually hitched a lift back to Poland with a group of humanitarians.he Texan marine \u2013 who was middle-aged and asked not to be identified \u2013 stayed on in Kyiv. We\u2019d met at the Cicada Hotel and had kept in touch over text messages. He was softer-spoken than King, with an almost business-like demeanour. While the other volunteers around him were posing for photos, swapping arrival stories and drinking beer, he\u2019d refrained. I asked him whether the Ukrainian front really was really so disorganised. He said it was, and blamed some of the chaos on the contingencies of conflict. But he suspected that some of what King thought was incompetence was deliberate: the Ukrainian army \u201cholds back info because they don\u2019t trust us\u201d. It was widely apparent that there were Russians in the ranks of Ukraine\u2019s volunteers, feeding information to higher-ups. The way to gain trust, wrote the Texan, was by \u201cshowing up\u201d \u2013 that is, killing Russians. \u201cIt\u2019s like a video game,\u201d he added. \u201cYou need to level with these guys by showing that you\u2019re here to work.\u201d I asked him what the fighting was like. Initially, he said, there was a lot of sitting around. \u201cWe \u2013 at least Western dudes \u2013 don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re used to streamlined logistics, lots of information, planning, sand tables, briefs, training, rehearsals and so on. This is \u2018sit around until it\u2019s time to load up and go fight\u2019. Very different. Took a while to adapt.\u201dThe next time I met David King he was far from the Kyiv front, back in Warsaw, exhausted and distraught by what he\u2019d witnessed in Ukraine. As we wandered Warsaw\u2019s streets, past pastel-coloured shopfronts and heaving Catholic churches, he dipped his feet into new conspiratorial currents, like a comedian testing fresh material. \u201cPope Francis is a demon-possessed satanist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a globalist, too.\u201d He had no money and was looking to set up a GoFundMe page to raise the funds for a plane ticket home. I asked him if he was worried about what to do next. No, he said. His life had become a series of meanderings and retreats and fumbled adventures, and his trip to Ukraine had turned out to be no different. \u201cI have decided to go back to the States to see if I can find \u2018Home\u2019 again\u2026\u201d he wrote to me in his last email.  is a journalist based in Athens.

{"title": "Britain\u2019s energy strategy is both timid and unrealistic", "content": "THE AUGURIES were poor. For several days before the British government released its energy-security strategy, cabinet ministers blew hot and cold on the subject of onshore wind turbines. The Treasury was reported to have turned down ministerial requests for more money to pay for home insulation. It looked alarmingly as though the government did not actually have an energy strategy.When the document appeared, on April 7th, all doubt was dispelled. It is now plain that the government does not have a proper energy strategy. Instead it has a collection of preferences and hopes, which reveal more about how Boris Johnson\u2019s government goes about its business than about the future of energy in Britain.To be charitable, Britain is trying to do something enormously difficult. The spur to the new energy strategy is the , which has reminded politicians of the undesirability of relying on . But as well as becoming more self-sufficient, Britain must reach zero net greenhouse-gas emissions by the year 2050. That entails decarbonising electricity generation while producing far more of it. Most homes will have to be heated by electric heat pumps rather than gas; and cars must be powered by batteries rather than oil. At the same time Britain must try to make energy cheaper. A sharp rise in wholesale gas prices is now feeding through into household fuel bills, causing terrifying increases in the cost of living.In short, as Mr Johnson puts it, \u201cwe need a flow of energy that is affordable, clean and above all secure\u2026a power supply that\u2019s made in Britain, for Britain.\u201d That confident, we-can-do-it tone suffuses the entire document. Britain, it boasts, will become \u201cthe Saudi Arabia of wind power\u201d. The government will \u201creverse decades of myopia\u201d and make \u201cthe big call\u201d on nuclear power. And did you know that Britain\u2019s power distribution lines, if laid end-to-end, would stretch 20 times around the world?The document is Johnsonian not only in its bombast, but also in its reliance on targets and vaguer \u201cambitions\u201d, many of them reassuringly far in the future. The government\u2019s ambition is that Britain will have 50 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030\u2014almost five times as much as today. Its aim is to have up to eight more nuclear reactors, and up to 24GW of deployed nuclear power by 2050. It expects that some of the new ones will be , a new technology being developed by Rolls-Royce. Its ambition for low-carbon hydrogen production by 2030 is twice as high as it was before.In contrast to its excitement about these three technologies, the strategy downplays energy efficiency. Instead of a bold plan to improve , the government envisages \u201ca gradual transition following the grain of behaviour\u201d involving little state spending. When it comes to onshore wind, the bombast abruptly vanishes. \u201cThe government recognises the range of views on onshore wind,\u201d it says. Rather than alter planning rules to make it easier to build turbines, it will hold a consultation about entering into partnerships with \u201ca limited number of supportive communities\u201d that might be interested in hosting wind farms in exchange for something, such as lower bills.These choices have puzzled and disappointed greens, who argue that suppressing demand through energy-efficiency measures and building wind turbines on land are among the cheapest, quickest ways of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. But the big problem is not that Britain will end up spending more money and cutting emissions more slowly than it needs to. Rather, by favouring expensive and sometimes untried technologies it is setting itself up to do not much at all. Nuclear power stations are expensive and slow to build, and under the \u201cregulated asset base\u201d model that the government favours, many of the costs will be loaded onto customers\u2019 bills years before they begin operating. It would take a brave prime minister to approve many of them, when the time comes. Michael Grubb, an energy expert at University College London, thinks the government might sign off on one new project, probably the 3.2GW Sizewell C in Suffolk, but not 24GW worth.The government has put forward one good idea. It announced this week that it will create a new independent body, the Future System Operator, to help manage the energy system and advise on strategy. That is sorely needed. Britain\u2019s power mix has already changed dramatically (see chart) and will continue to alter as ever more wind and solar farms are connected to the grid. Hydrogen will add further opportunities and complexities.The rapid rise in solar and wind power, though welcome, has been tricky to accommodate in an electricity system that was designed for fossil fuels. Because wind and solar power are intermittent, they force many other generators to operate intermittently, raising their costs. And Britain\u2019s wholesale electricity market operates on the \u201cmerit order\u201d principle, under which all active generators receive the price paid to the most expensive generator required to meet demand at a particular time. That generally means all power\u2014even solar and wind, which has a marginal generation cost close to zero\u2014is priced like gas power.Energy experts such as Mr Grubb and Sir Dieter Helm of Oxford University have pointed out these problems (and others) for years. Successive governments have tended to ignore them. The energy strategy suggests that Mr Johnson\u2019s administration is not capable of thinking realistically about the future. Perhaps the Future System Operator will be able to do some of the thinking for it.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/britain/britains-energy-strategy-is-both-timid-and-unrealistic/21808702", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T11:37:39Z", "date_published": "2022-04-08T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_blp512.jpg"},

He was taking shelter in the basement of a nearby house along with seven other men. time that Andriy Dvornikov spoke to his common-law wife was on March 5th. He called, speaking very quietly, to say he was in trouble. He had been trapped at a Ukrainian checkpoint in Bucha, a suburb to the north-west of Kyiv, when it came under artillery fire. He was taking shelter in the basement of a nearby house along with seven other men.One of them, Ivan Skyba, described what happened next. Russian soldiers found the group later that day and moved them to a base. They were told to take their clothes off and lie face down. Their captors searched their telephones and bodies for symbols and tattoos. To make the Ukrainians talk, the Russians killed one of them\u2014 \u201ca short, bespectacled guy from Ivano-Frankivsk\u201d, in Mr Skyba\u2019s words.Mr Dvornikov, who had fought in Donbas in 2015-16, had a paratrooper\u2019s tattoo. After a few hours of torture, an order was issued to kill them. A soldier asked his commander what he should do. The answer was \u201c \u201d (\u201cfucking do them in\u201d), but \u201cdo it away from the base.\u201d Mr Skyba says they were led to the side of the building and shot. He took a bullet in his side, but it went through his body. He survived by playing dead on the concrete floor. As soon as he heard there were no voices, he fled over a fence to a nearby home. Other Russian soldiers later found him there, but spared his life. Witnesses in Bucha stress that some Russian soldiers were polite. \u201cSome of them even said sorry,\u201d says one.As Russia\u2019s \u201cliberators\u201d have retreated from Kyiv back towards the Belarusian border, they have left a landscape of atrocities. In all, said Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor-general on April 3rd, 410 civilians had been killed around Kyiv. As investigators collected evidence of  and bodies were put into black plastic bags,  was able to verify reports of what appears to have been a summary execution.We found nine bodies lying at the side of a builder\u2019s yard in Bucha that had been used as a Russian base. All had gunshot wounds to the head, chest or both. At least two of the victims had their hands tied behind their backs. The smell of decomposition, among other things, suggested they were killed before Ukrainian forces liberated Bucha on March 31st.Such massacres have shocked the world. \u201cGenocide\u201d, Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky called it. The American president, Joe Biden, said that what happened in Bucha was a war crime and that Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, should face an international tribunal for it, though the chances of that seem remote. The Kremlin said the whole thing was a \u201cheinous provocation of Ukrainian radicals\u201d and cynically demanded a  Security Council meeting. At it, Mr Zelensky said: \u201cWe are dealing with a state that turns its veto at the  Security Council into [a] right to [cause] death.\u201d The  swiftly proposed new sanctions, which would ban Russian coal and close its ports to Russian vessels. But it stopped short of imposing an embargo on oil and gas exports, the corner stones of Russia\u2019s economy.The atrocities in Bucha fit a pattern. Terror, torture and murder have been Russian military tactics for as long as Vladimir Putin has been in power. \u201cThis is not an excess, this is the system which deems extreme violence to be the most effective way of suppressing resistance,\u201d one Russian expert explains. This method was honed during Russia\u2019s second war in Chechnya.In February 2000, barely a month after Mr Putin assumed Russia\u2019s presidency, his riot police and soldiers entered Novye Aldi, a suburb of Grozny, Chechnya\u2019s capital, and went from house to house murdering civilians, according to eyewitness accounts gathered by Memorial, Russia\u2019s main human-rights organisation, which was banned last year. Sweeps like these became known as , or \u201cmopping-up\u201d operations. Between 56 and 82 civilians were killed and at least six women were raped in Novye Aldi.The European Court of Human Rights found the Russian state guilty in that case, as well as others. But in Russia the crimes were never prosecuted, giving a sense of impunity to the armed forces. It was those who documented the crimes who suffered. In 2009 Natalya Estemirova of Memorial was abducted from her home in Chechnya and killed. Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter for  was gunned down three years earlier in Moscow.An information blockade imposed by the Kremlin has made it easier for Russian forces to get away with murder. So has the acquiescence of the Russian public, who tended to dismiss the war in Chechnya as something that was happening far away. Western governments did not, for the most part, let it get in the way of doing business with Russia.A cult of aggression has grown like a weed. Coverage of the first Chechen war in the mid-1990s, when Russia still had free media, was dominated by stories of tragedy and despair. But the second Chechen war was dominated by the propaganda of military heroism. Violence was hailed as proof of masculinity. \u201cMany [veterans] deliberately emphasise their ability to commit violence,\u201d says Elena Racheva, a social anthropologist at Oxford. One told her: \u201cI always had principles. My principle was not to leave enemies alive.\u201dFrom the early 2000s the Kremlin has led a campaign of military-patriotic mobilisation. Encouraged by state television, today\u2019s soldiers look to a father who fought in Afghanistan and Chechnya and a grandfather who fought in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45 as their role models. The war in Ukraine is framed as a re-enactment of the latter, with Ukrainians cast as Nazis.On April 1st the Russian defence ministry released a video featuring Aleksei Shabulin, a commander of a battalion that carried out a around Kyiv. \u201cMy great-grandfather went through the entire second world war and up to the year 1953 chased the fascist devils\u2026through Ukrainian forests,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a glorious successor of this tradition. Now my time has come and I will not disgrace my great-grandfather\u2014and I will go all the way.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/08/as-russian-soldiers-retreat-they-leave-evidence-of-war-crimes", "date_modified": "2022-04-09T23:29:49Z", "date_published": "2022-04-08T16:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_eup003.jpg"},

We heard details of the murder of Ukrainian men in Bucha, ordered by a Russian commander. Human Rights Watch, a charity, reports that Russian soldiers threw a smoke grenade into a basement in Vorzel, near Irpin, then shot a woman and her child as they emerged.Evidence like this has rightly caused a worldwide outcry.  and Poland\u2019s prime minister have accused Russia of genocide. Joe Biden, America\u2019s president, has called the enormities in Bucha a war crime. And the  secretary general asked for an investigation into the killings, alongside the several already under way.Investigators are likely to find that Russian forces should be indicted, even if they have not killed on such a systematic scale as to have committed genocide. The Geneva Conventions, which Russia has signed, outlaw war crimes, including wilful killing, causing great suffering and targeting civilians. The murders in Bucha would count. So would the bombing of the  theatre on which the Russian word for children was written large enough for targeters to see from the sky.

Russia does recognise the International Court of Justice, which hears disputes between governments, but that court also enforces its rulings in the .One response is to send Ukraine more arms and impose more sanctions on Russia. America will ban new investment there. The European Union has proposed blocking its ships and lorries and banning imports of coal.

Russian forces have a duty to protect Ukrainians, but they are treating them as if they are tools of war. Because the West, like Ukraine, rejects the Russian view that people are a means to an end, it should back the courts\u2019 efforts to show that every life matters.

{"title": "Ukraine sees a window of opportunity to push Russia back", "content": "ON MARCH 28TH Ukraine\u2019s general staff warned that the Russian army, within striking distance of , still wanted to take the capital.

As Russian troops retreated to Belarus and Russia, pursued by Ukrainians, Kyiv began returning to normal. No shots, shells or missiles have been heard since March 30th.

But although the battle is won, the war is not. Ukraine\u2019s general staff warned that the Russian army, within striking distance of , still wanted to take the capital. A week later that army had largely evaporated from both sides of the Dnieper river north of the city. As Russian troops retreated to Belarus and Russia, pursued by Ukrainians, Kyiv began returning to normal. No shots, shells or missiles have been heard since March 30th. Non-essential shops are re-opening. Vitaly Klitschko, the mayor, has urged civilians to wait until the end of the week to return; not all are heeding his advice. But although the battle is won, the war is not.Russia says its war aim is now to \u201cliberate\u201d Donbas in eastern Ukraine; some think that , Russia\u2019s president, wants to do so by Victory Day on May 9th, the date that commemorates Nazi Germany\u2019s surrender in 1945. Before the war began in February Russia controlled a third of the territory; since February 24th it has taken a lot more, including some of , a port city.Whether it has enough manpower to take it all remains open to question. By focusing its efforts in fewer places, Russia hopes to muster superior numbers. It has accordingly pulled back forces that were heading towards Kyiv from Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine. Units that were in Belarus are also being moved into western Russia, according to railway-tracking websites.The problem for Mr Putin is that these forces are spent. A quarter of his initial invasion force may have been wounded or killed. Out of 125 battalion tactical groups (s) gathered for the invasion, 29 have been \u201crendered non-combat effective\u201d, says a Western official, meaning they have had to be taken out of action or amalgamated with others. Fixing them and moving them east could take around a month.Beyond that, there is not much left in reserve: Russia committed three-quarters of its s to the war. Since then it has scraped together additional forces from wherever it can find them, including the exclave of Kaliningrad, wedged between hostile  states, and its garrisons in Georgia, which it invaded in 2008.Then there are conscripts. On April 1st Russia announced its annual draft of men aged 18 to 27, with the aim of conscripting 134,500 for a year. Conscripts cannot legally be sent to war without four months of training. In reality, some of last year\u2019s batch were sent in regardless. But Russia could not send them on a large scale\u2014nor properly mobilise its pool of reservists with previous experience\u2014unless Mr Putin formally acknowledged that his \u201cspecial military operation\u201d was, in fact, a war. And even if he did that, national mobilisation would take until the summer.So this is a good time for Ukraine to press its counter-attack: on every day during the final week of March, it gained more territory than it lost. But as long as Russian troops remain in Belarus, Ukraine cannot shift all its forces to Donbas. It has to protect Kyiv and defend its supply lines from the west. Nonetheless, it should be able to shift some units to the east and south, and to do so faster than Russia can.Ukraine, which mobilised fully on February 24th, probably has adequate manpower\u2014it is currently drafting another 10,000 to 20,000 men. Western arms continue to pour in. The Czech Republic is providing Soviet-made -72 tanks. More important, it says that, with Slovakia, it may allow Ukraine to use its facilities to repair equipment. Australia is sending armoured fighting vehicles. On April 5th America said it would send another $100m of anti-tank systems. But Ukraine will also need less eye-catching things like Soviet-era artillery ammunition to feed its guns in a long war of attrition.That is the sort of war that may be developing. Russia\u2019s original aim was to envelop Ukrainian forces in Donbas by striking their rear, converging on the city of Dnipro. Were it to try that now, having abandoned Kyiv and Sumy, its own flanks would be vulnerable to Ukrainian attacks from the north\u2014it would risk being encircled itself.So Russia is shifting to a more \u201cbrutish\u201d approach, says Michael Kofman of , a think-tank: \u201cIt looks as though they\u2019re going to frontally assault Ukrainian forces to steadily squeeze them out of Donbas.\u201d That would involve advancing south from Izyum, north from Mariupol and pressing in areas like Severodonetsk, where Ukrainian forces are trapped in a salient.In Donbas, Russia enjoys the advantage that its air force is stronger than it was around Kyiv, and Ukrainian air defences patchier. A frontal assault would also mean shorter supply lines, while the passage of time will mean less mud to contend with. Even so, Russia still seems to be repeating elementary mistakes it made in the first days of the war. \u201cEven as late as [April 6th], we\u2019re still seeing single files of Russian armour attempting to advance down roads, and then coming into problems when it\u2019s met by Ukrainian resistance,\u201d says the Western official.Mr Putin\u2019s gamble is that he can wear down Ukraine\u2019s army before his soldiers lose the will to fight. Some think, however, that a  may come first. Mark Cancian of , another think-tank, reckons that as casualties mount, supplies run out and morale dwindles, Russia\u2019s generals will eventually have to come together and force Mr Putin to face facts. But there seems likely to be a lot more fighting before that. \u201cThis has similarities to major set-piece battles from prior world wars,\u201d says Mr Kofman. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s going to come down not just to manpower and materiel, but also intangible factors\u2014skill, force, employment and morale.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/ukraine-sees-a-window-of-opportunity-to-push-russia-back/21808597", "date_modified": "2022-04-09T23:29:08Z", "date_published": "2022-04-08T16:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_eup503.jpg"},

At the wheel was the late Jim Henson, an American entertainer whose madcap puppets in every shade of the rainbow captured hearts and imaginations across the world., a town north of London, may recall an unusual car on the streets in 1978: a lime-green Lotus Eclat the bilious shade of Kermit the Frog, with customised headlamps styled as eyes. At the wheel was the late Jim Henson, an American entertainer whose madcap puppets in every shade of the rainbow captured hearts and imaginations across the world.\u201cThe Muppet Show\u201d almost did not get made: the three American television networks turned down Henson and his idea for a puppet variety show. Enter Lord Grade, a British executive, whose Elstree Studios became the launch-pad for a franchise with surprisingly long legs\u2014and spindly arms. Several decades after Henson\u2019s untimely death in 1990 at the age of 53, his fuzzy creations are still roaming the globe, spreading a message of tolerance, inclusivity and silliness. It is not just that the Walt Disney Company, which bought the Muppets in 2004, has continued the adventures of Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear et al. At the same time, Henson\u2019s own original puppets and archive, donated to the Museum of the Moving Image in New York in 2013, are keeping his legacy alive. Since 2017 an exhibit entitled \u201cThe Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited\u201d has travelled across America. It has been hosted in eight cities so far, from the Pacific Northwest to the deep South, with its latest stop in San Francisco. The current show at the Contemporary Jewish Museum is more than a nostalgic hit for the legions who grew up with \u201cSesame Street\u201d, where Muppets including Bert and Ernie and Count von Count first appeared. Today\u2019s youngsters, too, find pleasure in these lumps of felt. At a recent preview, two boys busily reconfigured several of Henson\u2019s extras, known as \u201cAnything Muppets\u201d, with moustaches and lips before staging an on-camera skit. The puppeteer\u2019s life, above all, shows the importance of following your deepest passions and beliefs, says Bonnie Erickson, a longtime collaborator who developed the Miss Piggy character. \u201cJim was a real optimist who believed things could get better, who believed in play as a way to collaborate and co-operate with others.\u201dThat playful exuberance bursts from every corner of the show\u2014and appeared early in Henson\u2019s life. He started drawing in childhood and staged his first puppet show in high school; he incorporated his first company, Muppets Inc., at the age of 22. Yet he saw himself equally as an experimental film-maker, producing a film and series of surreal shorts in the 1960s. A chase movie called \u201cTime Piece\u201d, which was nominated for an Academy Award, featured Henson racing through cities and sets in a tuxedo and top hat. Puppets, though, were his enduring love, appearing in later cult shows such as \u201cThe Dark Crystal\u201d (revived on Netflix in 2019) and \u201cFraggle Rock\u201d (rebooted on Apple TV+ this year). Kermit, especially, was his alter-ego. He was \u201cclosest to me\u201d, Henson said. \u201cThe character is literally my hand.\u201dAt its height in 1978, \u201cThe Muppet Show\u201d had some 230m viewers in more than 100 countries, and was by many accounts the world\u2019s most popular television programme. Dedicated fan clubs still exist today, including a Muppet Wiki with nearly 40,000 entries and the Twitter account \u201cToughPigs: Muppet Fans Who Grew Up\u201d. The skits developed by Henson and his writing partner, Jerry Juhl, were written for adults as well as children. Each character was a different colour, size or shape, expressing the wide variety of individuals in the world. Bert and Ernie, perhaps the best known, were opposites in many ways: one tall and grumpy, one short and sunny, yet for all their tussles they got along. It is this gentle brand of humour Henson used to dramatise disputes that best explains the Muppets\u2019 appeal, curators say. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more human than these Muppets,\u201d says Barbara Miller of the Museum of the Moving Image. \u201cThey have a secret sauce of humour without snakiness or meanness that highlights difference\u2014between characters, puppets\u2014but resolves conflict without so much [of today\u2019s] cultural baggage.\u201d At a time of intense political polarisation, the Muppets, Fraggles and friends remind visitors of the necessity of getting along. Ms Erickson still smiles at memories of the mutually supportive troupe who brought this gaggle of disparate characters to life. It was she who replaced Miss Piggy\u2019s trotters with sparkly gloves, caught the fake food thrown down by the Swedish Chef, and helped Henson get Kermit and Fozzie onto bicycles in a London park. \u201cIf we don\u2019t need good feelings now, collaboration and support for diversity, we never have,\u201d she says. Today more than ever, Americans could use some of that open-hearted Muppet love.

The victim is reported to have deserted the Syrian army, and his killers were probably Russian. At least one has been identified as an operative from , a Russian mercenary outfit with connections to Russian military intelligence that, not for the first time, is reportedly operating in Ukraine.The most high-profile Russian mercenary group, Wagner has ties that lead right to President Vladimir Putin. It first came to prominence in Ukraine in 2014 as Russia tried to break off the Donbas region in the east. Then, Wagner provided one of the services Mr Putin values from mercenaries: deniability. Its men could pass more plausibly than Russian soldiers as separatist fighters. Since then the group has deployed to a , including Syria, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic (), as well as dabbling in Sudan and Venezuela, always to prop up or install strongmen favoured by Mr Putin.In Ukraine today, Mr Putin can no longer hope for deniability from Wagner, nor for much benefit from another service he prizes from mercenaries\u2014lowered casualty counts among soldiers whose families might wonder why their loved ones were sacrificed. Since Russia already has some 190,000 troops in Ukraine, even a few thousand Wagner mercenaries have small chance of changing the outcome of the war. But they may make its conduct still more savage. For service in Ukraine, Russian recruiters have reached out to those who were turned down in the past for having too little experience or suspect backgrounds. \u201cThey\u2019re taking anyone and everyone,\u201d says Ilya Rozhdestvensky, a Russian journalist with long experience tracking mercenaries.The group reportedly takes its name from Hitler\u2019s favourite composer, Wagner, the call sign of its founder, Dmitry Utkin. Mr Utkin is a veteran of Russia\u2019s military intelligence, the , who fought in both Chechen wars and later commanded an elite , or special forces, unit. Wagner\u2019s ties to the Russian armed forces go on. Its training camp in Russia is near a  facility. In Libya, Syria and Venezuela, Russian military aircraft transported Wagner operatives in and out; in Libya the Russian armed forces also reportedly kept them well supplied. A shopping list of military hardware including tanks, an advanced radar system and hundreds of Kalashnikov rifles was found in a Wagner document recovered in Libya. Some of the gear could probably have been provided only by the Russian armed forces.Wagner operatives often use passports issued by a special desk linked to the Ministry of Defence\u2014the same desk that issued the passports of the two men who attempted in 2018 to assassinate Sergei Skripal, a former Russian spy, in Britain. In 2020, when Belarus surprisingly arrested 33 Russians who seemed to belong to the Wagner Group, Mr Putin took a personal interest and worked to secure their release. \u201cThey\u2019re not independent at all,\u201d summarises Kimberly Marten of Barnard College at Columbia University.Like all mercenary outfits in Russia, the Wagner Group does not officially exist, because Russian law does not permit mercenary activities. Yet in 2018 Mr Putin acknowledged its existence, suggesting its work was fine provided it took place outside Russia\u2019s borders. \u201cThey have every right to work and promote their business interests anywhere in the world,\u201d he said. Small wonder that Russia\u2019s authorities have shown little interest in holding Wagner forces accountable for their behaviour, including the torture in Syria.Some 10,000 men are believed to have served with Wagner since its inception, most of them former Russian soldiers with combat experience. Recruiters are said to prefer those with specialised military skills and without criminal records. The work is well paid: mercenaries in Africa receive as much as $4,000 per month.Though Wagner mercenaries have been dispatched on missions that served Russia\u2019s geopolitical interests, the organisation has also made plenty of money along the way. In most places Wagner operates, such as Mali or , it is paid by the local government. Sometimes the deal is sweetened with control of gold or diamond mines granted to Wagner or to companies linked to the group\u2019s main backer, Yevgeny Prigozhin. In Syria Mr Prigozhin was cut into oilfields; in Mali Wagner is reportedly pocketing $10m a month.At times, Mr Prigozhin appears to have had tensions with some Russian officials, such as the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu. In 2018 American air strikes killed about 200 Russian mercenaries who attacked an American-backed Kurdish outpost near Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria; Russia\u2019s regular army reportedly did little to avert the slaughter. Yet Wagner seems to have recovered from such setbacks, perhaps thanks to Mr Prigozhin\u2019s connections in the Kremlin.Mr Prigozhin served time in a Soviet prison as a young man, and upon his release he opened a hot-dog stand in St Petersburg. From that humble start he diversified into restaurants that drew the city\u2019s elite. After Mr Putin became president in 2000, he began bringing high-powered guests to Mr Prigozhin\u2019s establishments; President George W. Bush reportedly dined on duck-liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, black caviar and steak with morel mushrooms at New Island, a Prigozhin-owned restaurant floating in the Neva river. Juicier contracts for Mr Prigozhin to feed the armed forces soon followed. He was later entrusted with more serious missions, including the mercenary group that became Wagner and the internet \u201ctroll farm\u201d, the Internet Research Agency, that was indicted by Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, for spreading disinformation online to interfere with the American presidential election in 2016.For all its lucrative business, Wagner\u2019s record is mixed. It served Mr Putin\u2019s purposes in the Donbas in 2014 and after. And in Syria, Wagner mercenaries are believed to have played a key role in recapturing the city of Palmyra from Islamic State and in helping Russia\u2019s armed forces to keep Bashar al-Assad in power. But in 2019, when Wagner was hired to fight jihadists in northern Mozambique, its fighters beat a rapid retreat after at least seven of them were killed. In Libya about 1,000 Russian mercenaries have fought for Khalifa Haftar, a rebel general, against the unrecognised government. They have not overthrown the government and have been accused of war crimes, including murdering civilians. In , about 2,000 Wagner mercenaries are propping up President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra, but are far from vanquishing the rebels out to topple him.In the past six months about 1,000 Wagner operatives have arrived in Mali. They have already been accused, in a  report, of taking part with Malian soldiers in trussing up about 30 people, dousing them in petrol and burning them alive. Human Rights Watch, a pressure group, says Russian mercenaries with Malian forces summarily executed some 300 suspected Islamist fighters, an incident it calls \u201cthe worst single atrocity reported in Mali\u2019s decade-long armed conflict.\u201d Meanwhile, jihadists continue to advance.Reports of Wagner\u2019s arrival in Ukraine appeared just days after the invasion. Ukraine\u2019s security services announced that mercenaries had been dispatched to assassinate Volodymyr Zelensky, the president, and other officials. Yet there has been no independent confirmation of that, and analysts and journalists who track the group reckon their use for such a sensitive mission is improbable. Mercenaries do not appear to be fighting beside the Russian soldiers who invaded from Russia, Belarus and Crimea. Ukraine has released information about only two fighters with Wagner connections among the many Russians taken prisoner; those men said they fought with the group in the past, but came to Ukraine with the regular Russian army.Instead, mercenaries are reportedly moving into the parts of Donetsk and Luhansk that were already occupied, to reinforce separatists trying to break through Ukrainian lines. On March 28th the British Ministry of Defence said it expected Wagner to deploy more than 1,000 mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, including senior leaders. So far, those heading to Ukraine do not appear to be from the core group. \u201cThey\u2019re using the old Wagner infrastructure\u2014the base, the recruiting channels,\u201d says Ilya Barabanov, a Russian journalist who has reported extensively on the group. \u201cBut it\u2019s not what we\u2019re used to calling \u2018Wagner\u2019.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence says the mercenaries are a new incarnation of Wagner called \u201cLiga\u201d, Russian for \u201cleague\u201d. They are being offered more than 200,000 roubles ($2,367) per month, several times more than regular soldiers typically get.Russia may also be turning to Syrians and others who once fought beside Wagner. Mr Shoigu, the Russian defence minister, claimed to Mr Putin that 16,000 \u201cvolunteers\u201d from the Middle East were ready to fight in Ukraine. Videos from  also show armed African men declaring they want to fight for Russia. Though there is little evidence of more than a trickle to Ukraine so far, foreign fighters might add more bulk than mercenaries alone. Yet they may not prove particularly motivated. Many would probably be \u201cpress-ganged\u201d into it, as they were when Russia sent Syrians to back Mr Haftar\u2019s failed push in Libya, argues Ms Marten. During a decade of civil conflict, Syrian soldiers showed more aptitude for stealing household appliances and selling drugs than fighting.Western intelligence suggests some Wagner mercenaries may be leaving Libya for Ukraine. Perhaps even a few are departing from . But for now the signs of redeployments are limited. \u201cNo one cancelled the other commercial contracts,\u201d Mr Barabanov notes. Indeed, well after the war in Ukraine began, Wagner sent more mercenaries to Mali, says a French military official. \u201cWe think that there will be no major impact to deployments in Mali and ,\u201d he adds. Even if more Russian mercenaries do arrive in Ukraine, their record suggests they may contribute less to the momentum of the conflict than to the lengthening list of war crimes.

{"title": "Who should own a football club?", "content": "AROUND THIS time last year fans of Chelsea football club were on the streets protesting against the European Super League, a ham-fisted attempt by the owners of Europe\u2019s richest teams to usurp the sport\u2019s existing competitions for financial gain. It was a rare success for the lowly supporter: Roman Abramovich, the Russian oligarch who owns Chelsea, backed down. Other clubs also rapidly retreated, and the plan collapsed spectacularly within 48 hours. Perhaps emboldened by this victory, Chelsea\u2019s fans hope to wield their power again, this time to influence the decision about who will take Mr Abramovich\u2019s place. time last year fans of Chelsea football club were on the streets protesting against the European Super League, a ham-fisted attempt by the owners of Europe\u2019s richest teams to usurp the sport\u2019s existing competitions for financial gain.

Perhaps emboldened by this victory, Chelsea\u2019s fans hope to wield their power again, this time to influence the decision about who will take Mr Abramovich\u2019s place.The sale of Chelsea, triggered by sanctions imposed on Mr Abramovich over his relationship with Vladimir Putin, has attracted several suitors, ahead of the deadline for making a final offer on April 11th. Despite , the club\u2019s valuation has soared to an estimated $4bn. Owners of American sports franchises are involved in all four bids reportedly in the running.One of them, by a consortium led by the Ricketts family, has met particular resistance from some fans. Many are unhappy with the Americans\u2019 politics and views. The Rickettses are regular contributors to the Republican Party and, more worrying for some Chelsea supporters, Islamophobic emails sent by Joe Ricketts, the head of the family, surfaced last month. Some fans, looking at the Rickettses\u2019 unpopularity among fans of the Chicago Cubs, the American baseball team they also own, are concerned about the family\u2019s intentions: would they invest in footballing success or look to squeeze the club? Rival fans, too, are viewing the contest for the club with trepidation, albeit with different motives. If Chelsea\u2019s next owner is as free with money as was Mr Abramovich, who spent $2bn taking the west London club to the top, their teams would find it harder to compete.The ownership of English football clubs used to be far less contentious. The Football Association (), the game\u2019s national governing body, prevented owners from taking money out of clubs and limited dividend payments. Consequently, owners, usually local businessmen, though sometimes colourful characters, were little more than custodians. But many were custodians with tight fists, reluctant to invest. This resulted in a more competitive league but other aspects of football, such as the quality of stadiums, suffered.That changed in the 1980s. Owners were permitted to circumvent the \u2019s restrictions by using holding companies to extract money from clubs. Some clubs even went public. The launch of the Premier League in 1992 accelerated English football\u2019s already growing global appeal. Television revenues rocketed, flooding the clubs with new money. Lured by lucre and prestige, new types of owners came hunting. One sort just wanted to be part of the party, regardless of cost. Mr Abramovich said he bought Chelsea because he \u201cwas bored\u201d. (However, Catherine Belton, in her book \u201cPutin\u2019s People\u201d, suggested that the Russian president instructed him to buy the club, as a way for Russia to gain legitimacy in London. Mr Abramovich has denied this, and brought a libel claim last year, which has led to some amendments being made to the book.) The royal family of the United Arab Emirates sees Manchester City, which it bought in 2008 and in which it has since invested billions, as a tool of  more than as a financial investment. Both clubs have clearly benefited at rivals\u2019 expense. No wonder fans of other clubs crave similarly deep-pocketed owners. Newcastle United\u2019s supporters celebrated last year when Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign-wealth fund purchased their club, despite the kingdom\u2019s pitiful human-rights record.Another type of owner sees football as a financial investment, pure and simple. In 2005 the Glazers, another wealthy American family already in the sports business back home and looking to get wealthier, bought Manchester United. They financed the purchase with debt, which they plonked on United\u2019s balance-sheet. Fans have grumbled ever since; and United\u2019s run of success has lately dried up. Other forms of private equity are wading in too. But steady, assured revenues are hard to come by when competition is fierce (and, for smaller clubs, the threat of relegation looms). That can result in penny-pinching or ideas like the European Super League, which would have brought more revenue to Europe\u2019s biggest clubs partly by limiting competition\u2014an approach that antagonises fans who consider their teams to be cultural institutions rather than businesses. Unsurprisingly, many fans think the ideal ownership structure would involve themselves. They can point to Germany\u2019s Bayern Munich, and Spain\u2019s Real Madrid and Barcelona, three of the most successful clubs in Europe over the past decade\u2014each combining footballing excellence with fan representation. Yet this model too has its flaws. The supporter-elected board at Barcelona, for instance, racked up $1.5bn of ruinous debt. In Germany, \u201cthe 50+1\u201d model requires more than half of the voting shares in a club to be owned by members. This empowers fans but limits external investment. Bayern apart, German clubs struggle to compete in Europe\u2014or even at home. Bayern, who earn far more from commercial revenues than their domestic rivals, are on course for a tenth successive league title.Financial prudence, healthy competition and fans\u2019 interests are often at odds. So far the right balance has eluded governing bodies. Leagues are increasingly dominated by a handful of well-heeled clubs (even in England, which is more competitive than many, just eight clubs have won the top division in the past three decades, against 14 between 1950 and 1980). Fans often feel left out. Attempts by governing bodies to rein in reckless and excess spending have been feeble. In Britain, a fan-led review commissioned by the government has recommended setting up an independent regulator and introducing measures (such as a \u201cgolden share\u201d) to protect fans\u2019 interests. But that will mean overcoming the interests of existing owners and the reluctance of administrators. No one should hold their breath. Back at Chelsea, the Ricketts family have promised to heed supporters\u2019 concerns should their bid succeed. Among other things they have vowed never to join a European Super League. But their best hope of winning supporters over lies in delivering success on the pitch. Victory washes away many sins. Just listen to the Chelsea fans who chanted Mr Abramovich\u2019s name after he departed, despite his connection to the Kremlin.

So it is worth paying attention to her latest pronouncements. \u201cIt\u2019s euphoric right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are definite signs of excess.\u201dBut Ms Zelman, who has gone from investment banks to running an analysis firm, also knows the current rally is different from past ones, which suggests the downside may be less severe. Start with the evidence of potential danger. Prices have surged in America since early in the pandemic, much as they have throughout the rich world. In recent months they have risen by nearly 20% year on year, eclipsing their heady pace before the global financial crisis of 2007-09.Far from deterring buyers, the rally has only fuelled \u2014a fear of missing out. The typical home sold in March was on the market for just 38 days, down from a pre-pandemic norm of 67 for that time of year, according to Realtor.com, a listings website (see chart). And supply seems constrained. At the end of 2021 America had 726,000 vacant homes for sale; in the two decades before the pandemic that had never fallen below 1m.One critical variable is now changing, and rapidly at that, owing to the monetary-policy decisions of the Federal Reserve. Although the Fed has raised short-term interest rates by only a quarter of a percentage point so far this year, mortgage rates have soared by more than 1.5 points as investors price in more tightening to come. Normally, such a steep increase would cool the housing market, making monthly payments increasingly unaffordable.Yet thus far the red-hot market has remained resistant to rising mortgage rates. Partly that is because so many Americans took advantage of the extremely low rates available during the pandemic to take out new financing. About 70% of homeowners now have mortgages with rates of less than 4%, according to Ms Zelman. In 2018 just about 40% enjoyed such low borrowing costs. Another explanation is the wealth, at least on paper, that Americans have accumulated thanks to rising asset prices over the past two years. About a quarter of existing-home sales are all-cash transactions now, compared with a fifth before the pandemic, according to the National Association of Realtors.Resistant to rising rates, though, does not mean impervious. At some point high borrowing costs will crimp demand. Moreover, the fundamentals underpinning the property rally\u2014the limited supply of new homes\u2014may prove to be, in part, an artefact of the pandemic. Nearly 1.6m homes are under construction nationwide, the most since the early 1970s. The problem is that the housing sector is, like other parts of the economy, suffering from labour shortages and gummed-up supply chains. It is taking longer than normal to complete construction. A resolution of these constraints could move America from a property shortage to a glut.Ms Zelman is far from alone this time in her warnings. On March 29th a group of researchers with the Dallas Fed noted that their \u201cexuberance indicator\u201d, a gauge to detect housing bubbles, was flashing red. \u201cOur evidence points to abnormal  housing-market behaviour for the first time since the boom of the early 2000s,\u201d they wrote. Few expect a repeat of the collapse that followed that boom. Homeowners have healthier balance-sheets than they did 15 years ago, and borrowing standards are stricter. Nevertheless, the housing market today provides just another illustration of the rocky path that the Fed must navigate, with rampant inflation on one side and a bust on the other.

{"title": "Why America keeps delaying student-loan repayments", "content": "TEMPORARY EMERGENCY measures often outlast the crises that prompt them. So it is with federal student-loan repayments, which were suspended in March 2020 as a pandemic-relief measure. In August 2021 the Department of Education announced a \u201cfinal extension\u201d of the moratorium on payments for the $1.6trn owed to the federal government, to last until January 2022. Then, one month before that deadline, the White House announced a final, final extension, to run to the end of May 2022. Then, on the cusp of that new cutoff date, a final, final, final date was announced on April 6th. This extends the moratorium to August 31st.The repeated deferral of the issue looks increasingly odd. Most economic-relief programmes initiated in response to covid-19 have already been wound down: enhanced unemployment benefits, stimulus cheques and generous child benefits are all things of the past. A federal moratorium on evictions, on the grounds that these procedures might transmit the disease, was struck down by the Supreme Court in August 2021. In May the Biden administration will lift \u201cTitle 42\u201d, a Trump-era immigration policy that limited asylum-seeking on public-health grounds. It has usefully allowed Mr Biden to keep America\u2019s southern border mostly closed, at a time when the number of arriving migrants is the highest in a generation. Ending Title 42 is likely to spur an unpopular surge in attempted migration across it. If the unemployed, poor children, renters at risk of eviction and migrants are no longer receiving special pandemic support, then why are college-educated Americans?The answer is one of bureaucratic capacity and Democratic Party politics. Unlike other measures, which require congressional approval or have been subjected to judicial review, the decision to delay student-loan repayments can be made by the executive branch alone. The education department has also been slow to set out the new payments regime after the moratorium, thereby justifying continued delays.The stalling is also one of the few sops that the administration can throw to progressives in the party who are dejected at the failure of the president\u2019s boldest proposals in Congress. Democratic senators such as Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, have been pushing for a more sweeping policy that would cancel debt of up to $50,000 per student. They argue that the president has the authority to do so unilaterally because the Higher Education Act of 1965 grants the education secretary the right to waive and release loans. The president, who supports a more modest cancellation amount of $10,000, is sceptical of such reasoning. But this policy of delays also presents a paradox. In the same statement announcing the latest extension, Mr Biden crowed about \u201cthe greatest year of job growth on record\u201d and \u201cthe fastest economic growth in nearly 40 years\u201d. But he also insisted that resumption of normal payments would plunge millions of borrowers into \u201csignificant economic hardship\u201d.The indecision is not without costs. Because of the length of the payments suspension and rising inflation, the effective average cancellation has amounted to $5,500 per student so far, according to calculations (based on the present-value cost of the delays) by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), a think-tank. Already, the policy has cost $100bn (forgiving $50,000 would cost almost $1trn).This outdated covid-relief programme has another problem, too. It is not particularly progressive. College-educated Americans command a sizeable wage premium; even those who do not get degrees have higher earnings. Those who attend graduate school often take out large loans at higher interest rates than for undergraduate degrees. The CRFB estimates that the effective debt cancellation for students who went to medical or law school is between $29,500 and $48,500 (see chart). For those with two-year degrees and those who did not finish college\u2014the most economically vulnerable\u2014the effective benefit has been less than $3,500. \u201cThe problem with universal loan forgiveness is that you end up with a system where a lot of the money goes to successful, affluent, white students,\u201d says Adam Looney, a professor at the University of Utah and former official at the Treasury Department. It is analogous to pausing all mortgage repayments to help a minority of struggling homeowners.That is not to say that America\u2019s university-financing system is functioning well. Government management of income-driven repayment plans, which are supposed to limit the burden on poorer borrowers, has been shambolic. An investigation by America\u2019s National Public Radio found that out of 4.4m borrowers eligible for forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of payment, only 32 had actually received it. There are also significant disparities in financial outcomes based on race. \u201cBlack borrowers borrow more, they are more likely to borrow, and they struggle more with repayment than other borrowers do,\u201d says Victoria Jackson of the Education Trust, a research and advocacy group. Twelve years after starting college, white men have paid off 44% of their student-loan debts, her research shows; black students owe 12% more than when they started.Targeted approaches to remedying this exist already. Federal Pell grants, which pay for poor students\u2019 attendance, have fallen far behind the increased cost of higher education. Granting relief based on debt-to-income ratios would be more progressive than less discriminating policies. That would require a more wholesale revision than another few months\u2019 delay. But come August, with punishing mid-term elections just months away, Mr Biden may find yet more justification for pushing off hard choices.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/04/08/why-america-keeps-delaying-student-loan-repayments", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T15:18:33Z", "date_published": "2022-04-08T21:06:39Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220409_USP505.jpg"},

In the ensuing 45 years it has financed the purchase of 9m homes.As restrictions on private-sector enterprise were gradually eased, \u2019s chairman, Deepak Parekh, adeptly launched other financial institutions. Insurance came in 2000, and asset management in 1999. But none was as important as  Bank, which was created in 1994 when private banking licences began to be granted.  kept a 26% stake in the new entity and required the bank to work through it when providing mortgages.For years there were advantages in maintaining separate institutions. Banks had access to cheap funding through deposits, but paid for the privilege through onerous capital requirements and rules that made them devote 40% of credit to \u201cpriority\u201d areas, such as farming. Non-bank finance firms were easier to create\u2014thousands sprang up\u2014and faced less-stringent lending or capital requirements, but lacked cheap overnight deposits.It proved a messy, even dangerous development, as many went on a lending and borrowing binge. In 2018-19 several prominent non-banks, including & and two housing-finance firms, collapsed. There were fears of more failures to come, and funding dried up for many finance companies. That in turn led to a credit crunch.Since then, regulatory changes have been quietly instituted, making life harder for the non-banks. The complex capital requirements imposed on them have been raised, for instance, to bring them largely in line with banks. That has made the operating restraints on finance companies somewhat bank-like, but without the benefits of cheap deposits. Jefferies, an investment bank, estimates  pays 6% for its funding, compared with 3.7% for  Bank. The spread for other finance companies is probably wider.With the merger, that distinction will disappear, providing a meaningful cost saving and competitive advantage. Meanwhile,  Bank, which has a sprawling network of 6,500 branches, ten times as many as its housing-finance cousin, will be able to offer mortgages to its customers directly\u2014something that might have doubled its size had it been able to do so all along, said Sashidhar Jagdishan, the bank\u2019s chief executive, on April 4th. Investors were unsurprisingly giddy at the prospect, with the share prices of both firms rising sharply. The mood in Mumbai\u2019s stately Taj Hotel, where the merger was announced, was equally ebullient, as the city\u2019s leading dealmakers speculated about what other changes might, once again, follow in \u2019s wake.

People are not portrayed in severe distress. Reports often focus on children, as in recent packages showing Ukrainian refugees starting school in Poland, or celebrating Purim in Israel. Reporting aims to provide \u201chonest reassurance\u201d, says the programme\u2019s editor, Lewis James. A recent & with the \u2019s man in Kyiv emphasised that no British troops had been deployed.Everything must be explained: viewers may not know who Vladimir Putin is or even, at the younger end of the age range, what Russia is. Producers and presenters visit schools to try out bulletins and see what is misunderstood. Ahead of big events like elections, researchers do fieldwork to find out what children already know (Donald Trump needed little introduction, they discovered).It is tempting to protect youngsters from bad news. Yet \u201cchildren are most disturbed when there\u2019s an information vacuum\u201d, Mr James argues.

Take the prosaic topic of food security. The pandemic, geopolitical tensions and heavy rainfall last year (which may lead to a wretched wheat crop) threaten China\u2019s grain supply. Lately officials have been echoing the exhortation of President Xi Jinping that \u201cthe people\u2019s rice bowl must be firmly held in their own hands at all times.\u201d In non-party-speak, the government is thinking hard about how to keep the world\u2019s most populous country fed.Past leaders have at times struggled with this task. Tens of millions of Chinese perished in the famine caused by Mao Zedong\u2019s ruinous policies in the late 1950s. Such a catastrophe is inconceivable today. But rows with Australia and Canada have made Chinese officials worry that the copious amounts of grain the two countries supply might one day be cut off. They note that soyabean imports from America plunged when Donald Trump launched his trade war. The conflict in Ukraine adds another layer of concern. Though China has tacitly backed Russia\u2019s invasion (and abruptly lifted its ban on Russian wheat), the turmoil could mean less, or pricier, food in Chinese bowls. Last year Ukraine supplied China with 29% of its imported corn and 26% of its imported barley.Global food prices were rising even before the war started to affect the supply of grains and fertiliser ingredients. The conflict scares China for another reason, too. The harsh sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries make China nervous that it would face similar punishment were it to invade Taiwan. How, officials in Beijing ask, can China rely on such fickle foreigners for its basic needs?The regime has dealt with these concerns in two important ways. It has stockpiled food\u2014or, as critics say, hoarded it. Over the past five years China\u2019s purchases of everything from soyabeans to pork have soared. America\u2019s Department of Agriculture predicts that by the middle of this year China will hold 69% of the world\u2019s maize (corn) reserves, 60% of its rice and 51% of its wheat. All this to feed 18% of the world\u2019s population. Last year a Chinese official said that the country\u2019s grain stocks were \u201chistorically high\u201d and that it had enough wheat to meet demand for 18 months. China\u2019s big purchases have pushed up global prices, say analysts.In the longer term China may hope to diversify its suppliers. This will be difficult, says Zhang Hongzhou of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. So it is also trying to become self-sufficient. One benchmark calls for Chinese producers to meet 95% of the country\u2019s demand for basic grains. On rice they pass. On sorghum and barley they fail. On maize and wheat they come close. Genetically modified crops would help. The government favours the technology, but it has been slow to introduce it because of public concern.\u201cEven if China decides it wants to be self-sufficient, it is now pretty much impossible,\u201d says Dr Zhang. That may not stop it from trying, though. Mr Xi, a fervent nationalist, wants more of what China consumes to be made at home. Or, as he put it last year: \u201cThe rice bowl must mainly contain Chinese grain.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/china/2022/04/09/when-china-worries-about-food-the-world-pays", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T11:08:24Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220409_CNP002_0.jpg"},

He was young, clever and eminently reasonable. Also, it was a time of panic for liberals. first elected president of France in 2017, Emmanuel Macron immediately became a standard-bearer for radical centrism. He was young, clever and eminently reasonable. Also, it was a time of panic for liberals.Britain had voted the previous year to leave the European Union. America had just elected Donald Trump. Across Europe populists were climbing in the polls, even in sober places like Sweden, Denmark and Germany. The far left were in power in Greece. Italy\u2019s Northern League would soon enter government as half of an all-populist coalition that flirted with leaving the euro and rebuffed migrants rescued in the Mediterranean. All around the rich world politicians who promised to raise walls, ignore experts and turn back the clock to an imaginary golden age were in the ascendant. No wonder Mr Macron\u2019s triumph in one of Europe\u2019s most pivotal countries brought sighs of relief.On April 10th Mr Macron will face voters once again. This time he is running not so much on his aspirations for the radical centre, but on his record as a nuts-and-bolts reformer, on his vision for world affairs, and as a leader who has reinvigorated French politics. In one sense, Mr Macron looks as if he will soon be able to say his record has been vindicated.  gives him a 98% chance of making the second round on April 24th and a 78% chance of  (albeit a number that has recently been shrinking). Victory would be a remarkable achievement. Not since Charles de Gaulle in 1965 have the French re-elected a president who has a majority in the assembly. However, the closer you look, the more liberals around the world should see Mr Macron as a cautionary tale.It is in economic policy that his centrism has been most successful. Before taking office in 2017, he argued that France should be open to globalisation, but try harder to equip its citizens with the skills they needed to adapt to change. His pro-market labour and regulatory reforms embodied this philosophy and they have led to an impressive rebound in employment and new-business creation. Rather than trying to preserve redundant jobs, he has boosted training and early education. At the European level, he was a driving force behind the establishment of the , a \u20ac750bn ($818bn) jointly guaranteed fund to help Europe\u2019s weaker economies dig themselves out of the hole into which covid-19 had cast them.He has, however, left plenty to do in a second term. Mr Macron has been too eager to reach for the levers of state control, whether capping electricity prices or meddling in the management of hypermarkets. For all his -honed competence, he has failed to restore hope to France\u2019s left-behind. Though his supporters would be quick to point out that covid got in the way, he has failed to overhaul the labyrinthine pensions system.As an international statesman, Mr Macron correctly identified the threat to the Western order from a rising China and an irascible Russia. His solution was to attempt to boost the European Union\u2014a forum where France\u2019s voice counts\u2014even if that undercut the institutions that bind the West together. Rather than confront Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, he argued for building bridges. He wanted to downplay , which he accused of suffering \u201cbrain death\u201d, by building up a European counterpart. Yet, as the war in Ukraine has shown, America\u2019s role in defending Europe is indispensable. Although his efforts to defeat jihadists in the Sahel were courageous and laudable, they have yielded few results and are now unravelling. His dealings with a puerile post-Brexit Britain were petulant\u2014and just what Britain\u2019s unserious prime minister wanted.It is in reinvigorating French politics that Mr Macron has most fallen short. In the election in 2017 he trounced Marine Le Pen, a nostalgic nationalist, by 66% to 34%. If she makes it to the second round, which is likely, the polls today say Mr Macron would win only narrowly, by 53% to 47%. The proportion of French who tell pollsters that they will vote for a candidate of the nationalist right or the anti-capitalist left in the first round is 51%, slightly more than voted that way in 2017.In other words, five years of government by the world\u2019s centrist standard-bearer has eroded support for the centre. There are many reasons for this. War and the pandemic have polarised politics, and not only in France. Mr Macron also sometimes repels voters with his aloof Jupiterian manner. Critics dub him \u201cle pr\u00e9sident des riches\u201d. The label sticks, partly because he cut France\u2019s unworkable wealth tax, but mostly because his manner is that of the high-flying banker he once was. Mr Macron also faces a problem that responsible politicians always face when running against . He offers policies boringly grounded in reality. They say whatever will stir up voters, whether or not it is true.The last reason is that Mr Macron has shown an illiberal neglect of institutions. Although the old politics had too many time-serving deputies, the parties of the centre-left and centre-right have become sideshows in presidential politics. True, responsibility for renewal lay with them, but he made their job harder by poaching their best talent. What is left is a contest between Mr Macron and a cacophony of extremists on the left and the right. As a result, the nearest thing France has to an opposition leader is Ms Le Pen\u2014a historic admirer of Mr Putin who would flout  rules by favouring French citizens for everything from housing to jobs. Her 21% chance of becoming president is alarmingly high.In 2016 Mr Macron wrote: \u201cIf we don\u2019t pull ourselves together in five years or ten years, [Ms Le Pen] will be in power.\u201d What should centrists make of the worrying fact that, despite all he has done, his words are as true today as they were then?One lesson is that complex trade-offs struggle to defeat slogans. Politics is so much about tribes and identity that material gains in terms of jobs and economic growth are necessary but not sufficient for re-election. Another is that one person cannot sustain the radical centre. That is not only because too much is riding on each re-election and on a successor turning up, but also because, as centrists know, individuals are flawed. French centrism and its Anglo-American liberal cousins are systems. They require constant renewal, through argument and competition. Mr Macron still has our vote, but he needs company.

This says that Mr Putin attacked Ukraine in self-defence, after America encroached on Russia by pushing European nations into the  military alliance. No matter that this turns history on its head, and ignores the pleas of ex-Soviet satellite states to join  as a defence against Russian aggression. To China,  enlargement is a hostile act which calls to mind American alliance-building in Asia. That makes Russia an invaluable partner in a global contest against American bullying, which China can ill afford to abandon. By this cold logic, Ukraine\u2019s agonies are a distraction.A second explanation for China\u2019s embrace of Russia is harder to see and hear, for it involves an indoctrination campaign within the Communist Party. This draws lessons from the \u201ctragedy\u201d of the Soviet Union\u2019s disintegration. It takes its lead from Mr Xi, who casts the Soviet collapse as a crisis of lost communist faith. Several times during his first decade as leader, Mr Xi has condemned Soviet party leaders and officials for becoming a self-serving caste and for losing political control of the army. Above all, Mr Xi blames the Soviet collapse on \u201chistorical nihilism\u201d, jargon for allowing ideological foes to dwell on dark episodes in history.A new, 101-minute Chinese documentary made for internal party use, \u201cHistorical Nihilism and the Soviet Collapse, Reflections on 30 years since the Disintegration of the Soviet Party and Nation\u201d, takes up that charge. Though not widely publicised, the film has been studied since late last year. There are brief reports of screenings all around China, in central and provincial government bodies but also at universities and law courts, municipal party committees and at least one local forestry bureau: evidence of a campaign ordered from the top. The film has not been released in cinemas or on television, but may be found online.The film lionises Stalin. It blames famines that followed his collectivisation of agriculture on rich peasants hoarding grain. It denies that his political purges killed millions, though it admits to some excesses. The documentary calls it slander to accuse Adolf Hitler and Stalin of jointly launching the second world war (Poland, which the two tyrants invaded from the west and the east, might disagree). It expresses outrage at those who question whether some Soviet-era heroes and martyrs are inventions. And it accuses the West of scheming to undermine the Soviet Union for decades by handing Nobel prizes to dissenting writers, inviting reform-minded officials on academic exchanges and, by the late 1980s, supporting civil society and a free press. The film\u2019s villains include Stalin\u2019s successor, Nikita Khrushchev, whose denunciation of Stalin\u2019s personality cult is called \u201c90% lies\u201d. The last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, is blamed for capitalist policies that\u2014the film asserts\u2014destroyed a planned economy that had outperformed America\u2019s. There follow scenes of post-Soviet chaos crafted to appal watching officials, involving toppled communist memorials and mobs attacking former oppressors. Then comes the Putin era, with proud war veterans and goose-stepping troops in a sunlit Red Square, over the strains of Russia\u2019s national anthem. Mr Putin is hailed for commissioning new, patriotic history books.The film is revealingly odd. It reflects some obsessions of Putin-era Russia, from celebrating wartime victories to paranoia about Western infiltration. But its defence of collectivisation and of the planned economy would strike even Putin loyalists as bizarre: they believe in crony capitalism, not Marxism. Nor does the Kremlin propaganda machine expend energy downplaying Stalin\u2019s cult of personality, or insisting that long-ago heroes literally existed. These choices are more Chinese than Russian. Time and again the film defends aspects of the Stalin era that bring to mind Communist China\u2019s founder, Mao Zedong. Mao set in motion rural famines and political purges that killed millions. His planned economy left the country bankrupt. He ordered the masses to learn from the faked or invented achievements of model communes and model heroes, often to disastrous effect. Meanwhile the film praises aspects of Mr Putin\u2019s record that also apply to Mr Xi. China\u2019s leader has had history textbooks rewritten and passed laws against disrespecting martyrs and heroes. Under Mr Xi, such values as freedom of speech are called tools of Western subversion, designed to topple the party through \u201cpeaceful evolution\u201d.Above all, the film helps Mr Xi by suggesting that intensely personalised rule is no bad thing, at one point showing young Russians kissing images of Mr Putin. Later this year Mr Xi is expected to seek a third term as party chief, upending norms put in place after the horrors of Mao\u2019s decades-long reign. Reports about screenings of the documentary end in strikingly similar ways: officials stress the importance of \u201ccorrect\u201d history, then conclude that what matters most is loyalty to the Communist Party of China and to Mr Xi.There is a warning here for foreign governments wondering why Mr Xi will not repudiate Mr Putin\u2019s crimes. China\u2019s support for Russia is in part geopolitical, with Mr Putin seen as an irreplaceable comrade in a fight with America. But it involves domestic political calculations, too. Chinese ideologues see benefits in identifying Mr Xi\u2019s brand of nationalism with Mr Putin\u2019s. As long as that holds true, asking Mr Xi to disown Russia and side with the West is like asking him to break with himself.

The Chinese authorities have long taken a different view, considering the review by foreign regulators of accounting documents drawn up in China for Chinese companies listed outside the mainland as an infringement on sovereignty, potentially punishable by death. The government softened its stance in 2020, when some such documents were shared with a Hong Kong accounting body. Now it seems ready to open the books to American regulators, who have been keen for a peek for more than a decade, in order to ensure the soundness of Chinese securities listed in New York.On April 2nd the China Securities Regulatory Commission () indicated that it will allow American inspections of Chinese accounting papers. The concession from the Chinese government is a breakthrough in one of the costliest regulatory spats in capital-markets history.Without the reviews, an American law from 2020 could eventually force nearly $1trn-worth of Chinese stocks off New York\u2019s exchanges. Although this would not happen until 2023 at the earliest, the mere prospect has exacerbated a sharp sell-off in Chinese technology stocks abroad, already battered by a broad clampdown on the tech industry at home. The  Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese firms listed in New York, is down by two-thirds from its peak in February 2021. The publication last month of a list of 11 candidates for delisting by America\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission () shaved another $260bn from the collective value of American-listed Chinese stocks.Market sentiment was boosted by the \u2019s decision to cut a clause in securities rules that \u201con-site inspections will be dominated by domestic regulators or depend on the conclusions of inspections by domestic regulators.\u201d The Chinese stocks have recouped most of the losses sustained after the \u2019s warning. Still, investors remain wary. The shares trade far below their prices a year ago, and they have performed worse than either Chinese tech firms listed in Hong Kong or American tech stocks overall (see chart).One reason is growing concern over geopolitical friction between China and the West. This, reckons Deutsche Bank, \u201chas permanently impaired\u201d valuations of Chinese stocks in America. It is also unclear how China\u2019s newfound fondness for information-sharing will work in practice. The  proposes setting up a \u201ccross-border regulatory co-operation mechanism\u201d to conduct the inspections. This may fall short of American demands for independent reviews. The  also retains the power to approve foreign inspections. Investors may distrust its assurances that it would only rarely deny such approval because of the sensitivity of the material.And doubts persist about how much protection American oversight would actually afford investors. Chinese regulators with full access to accounts have failed to spot many a fraud. Chinese executives seldom face punishment in their home country for defrauding American shareholders, says Soren Aandahl of Blue Orca Capital, a Texan short-seller which has uncovered mischief at some Chinese firms. Until that changes, an incentive to fiddle with the numbers will remain. After all, books don\u2019t get uncooked merely by being opened.

That makes it difficult to contain\u2014even for China, which tries to stomp promptly on any outbreak. A cluster of infections in Shanghai, for example, has forced the government to impose a hurried lockdown for which it seems woefully unprepared.The variant\u2019s speed also makes China\u2019s economic prospects unusually hard to track. A lot can happen in the time between a data point\u2019s release and its reference period. The most recent hard numbers on China\u2019s economy refer to January and February. Those (surprisingly good) figures look dated, even quaint. For most of that time, there was no war in Europe. And new covid-19 cases in mainland China averaged fewer than 200 per day, compared with the 23,107 reported on April 7th. Relying on official economic figures is like using a rear-view mirror to steer through a chicane.For a more timely take on China\u2019s economy, some analysts are turning to less conventional indicators. Baidu, a search engine and mapping tool, provides a daily mobility index, for instance. Over the week to April 3rd, this was more than 48% below its level a year ago. The index is best suited to tracking movement between cities, says Ting Lu of Nomura, a bank. To gauge the hustle and bustle within cities, he uses other indicators, such as subway trips. Over the week ending April 2nd, the number of metro journeys in eight big cities was nearly 34% lower than a year ago. In Shanghai, where many subway lines are now closed, the number of trips was down by 93%, a worse drop than in early 2020.The two numbers that worry Mr Lu most track distribution services. In the week ending April 1st, an index of express deliveries by courier companies was nearly 27% below its level at a similar point last year. Over the same period, an index of road freight fell by 12.8%. The decline looks especially stark because the measure was rising briskly at the end of last year.Unconventional measures are all the more valuable in China because of doubts about the official data. The strong figures for January and February, for example, are not only old but odd. They suggest that investment in \u201cfixed\u201d assets, like infrastructure, manufacturing facilities and property, grew by 12.2% in nominal terms, compared with a year earlier. But that is hard to square with double-digit declines in the output of steel and cement. The recovery in property investment also looks peculiar alongside the fall in housing sales, starts and land purchases. When some local governments said that they were double-checking their figures at the behest of the National Bureau of Statistics () it became clear that the official statistics look odd even to the official statisticians.China\u2019s high-frequency indicators proved their worth in spring 2020. Economists were timid at first in cutting their growth forecasts. No one knew exactly how the economy would react or what the  would be prepared to report. Armed with evidence from high-frequency data, forecasters were eventually brave enough to predict a  decline in the first quarter of 2020. Indeed, it shrank by 6.8%, according to even the official figures.The timeliness of unconventional indicators makes them valuable in periods of flux. Still, \u201cthere are many traps,\u201d says Mr Lu. Any short period can be distorted, say by bad weather, or holidays. And annual growth rates can be skewed by past idiosyncrasies. Moreover, what does a dramatic weekly decline in road freight mean for quarterly  growth? It is impossible to say with any precision. Many indicators also have only a short history. As a h student, Mr Lu was trained in econometrics. \u201cBut with only one or two years of data, if I used the kind of techniques I learned at school, people would laugh at me.\u201dTo help avoid some of the traps, Mr Lu and his team watch \u201ca bunch of numbers\u201d. \u201cIf seven or eight out of ten indicators are worsening, then we can be confident that  growth is getting worse,\u201d he says. Right now, he thinks, \u201csomething must be going very wrong.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/omicron-is-dealing-a-big-blow-to-chinas-economy/21808576", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T14:07:20Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_fnp003.jpg"},

She will be the fourth person of colour and the first black woman to serve on the court. But Hamilton might have been puzzled had he witnessed the three-week process leading to this moment.Few of the 47 Republicans vowing to oppose Ms Jackson\u2019s nomination professed concerns about her character or her fitness. She won near-universal praise for her intellect and qualifications: two Harvard degrees and three judicial clerkships, including to Justice Breyer; two federal judgeships; and service as a federal public defender. Senators of both parties complimented her on her poise and charm.For Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, Republicans who supported Ms Jackson\u2019s ascent last June to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit, her appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March was strong enough to win their votes again. Senator Mitt Romney, who opposed Ms Jackson last year but switched his vote, called her a \u201cwell-qualified jurist and a person of honour\u201d. Ms Murkowski lamented \u201cthe corrosive politicisation of the review process\u201d.Republican criticism of Ms Jackson ranged from routine to caustic. Senator Thom Tillis said he worried the nominee would \u201clegislate from the bench\u201d, a sentiment repeated by many Republicans despite Ms Jackson\u2019s vow to \u201cstay in my lane\u201d and avoid intruding on the duties of the legislative branch. Other charges included her refusal to answer questions about whether more seats should be added to the Supreme Court (a matter that rests in the hands of Congress, not the justices).A few Republicans aimed to paint Ms Jackson as soft on crime by focusing on sentences she gave to people convicted of child-pornography offences as a district-court judge. Several conservative commentators dismissed these claims; one called them \u201cmeritless to the point of demagoguery\u201d. That did not stop Senator Tom Cotton contrasting Ms Jackson with her namesake, Justice Robert Jackson, who went to Nuremberg to prosecute Nazi war criminals after the second world war. \u201cThis Judge Jackson\u201d, Mr Cotton said, \u201cmay have gone there to defend them.\u201dMs Jackson deflected questions about critical race theory, how to define a woman and where, on a ten-point scale, she rates her religiosity. She recounted that when she was a freshman walking through Harvard Yard another black woman, seeing self-doubt on her face, admonished her to \u201cpersevere\u201d. Senator Cory Booker recited a poem by Maya Angelou where \u201cbitter, twisted lies\u201d could not keep a woman down. Ms Jackson showed patience and command\u2014traits she may need to draw upon as one of three liberal justices on a court with six conservatives.The hearings, however historic, cast a pall over Hamilton\u2019s vision of fruitful cross-branch collaboration. Lindsey Graham, a Republican who voted for Ms Jackson last year, not only flipped his vote but gave a dose of realpolitik during the Senate Judiciary Committee meeting on April 4th. If Republicans controlled the Senate (a distinct possibility after this year\u2019s mid-terms), he said, Ms Jackson \u201cwould not have been before this committee\u201d.

This only infuriated his superiors. So from their camp at La Higuera, a village of no more than 20 dwellings in the dry broken hills of southern Bolivia, he was now climbing up to the schoolhouse. It was a humble place, built of mud and thatch, and silent now the children were away. But inside it was a legend, the most famous guerrilla leader anywhere, whose revolutionary socialist ideas had spread from Cuba all over Latin America and then beyond. He had been absent for years, fomenting trouble on Fidel Castro\u2019s orders in Congo, Tanzania, Vietnam and even Europe. Now he had turned up in Bolivia with a ragtag band of guerrillas, and the day before A and B Company had run into them.The fight had been fierce. Ter\u00e1n, a 26-year-old non-commissioned officer in Company A, saw two good friends killed in front of him. But Che had lost more, and was wounded and his carbine-barrel shattered, so he surrendered. He looked almost ordinary then, like some tramp, unkempt and rasping with asthma in a filthy uniform. But when he was given some tobacco for his pipe, and cheekily asked whether anyone had any Astoria, the old charm came out again.To the man who now had to kill him, the task was dreadful. He needed a stiff drink, but could find only beer, so he shouldered his  automatic and struggled on with a slopping bottle in each hand. He had tried to find a better rifle, too, but had no luck. No luck with anything that day.Why he had been picked remained a mystery. He was a good soldier, his superiors said, efficient and calm, did his duties well. His father was in commerce, but he had chosen the army in his teens, gone to the Sergeants\u2019 School in his home town of Cochabamba, and had made enough progress to become an instructor there. He was nothing special, though, and no more eager than anyone else to volunteer. Or perhaps a bit more, with his friends just killed and his wife Julia about to give birth back at home. Whatever had drawn him to the colonel\u2019s notice, it led him now to the schoolhouse door.If he had known then how his life was about to change, he would never have raised his hand. Almost all the rest of his existence was spent in hiding and denial. In December that year he let Michelle Rey from  take his picture and label him as Che\u2019s killer. It remained the only clear photo of him until his pensioner\u2019s  decades later. In between, in effect, he disappeared. He gave no hint of his story either publicly or even privately, to his six children or their children. There was said to be a \u201ccurse of Che\u201d, by which people involved in his death met sudden or violent ends. He did not need to believe in that to feel he was a marked man.Until he retired from the army in 1997 with the rank of senior warrant officer, both the army and the government protected him. He also stayed in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia\u2019s biggest city, but moved about in its labyrinth of streets, giving out no address except to claim his old-age benefit. Sometimes he went by the name \u201cPedro Salazar\u201d. When two reporters from Spain\u2019s  newspaper tracked him down in 2014, they found him in a middle-class street in a house behind high green railings, with a frisky Rottweiler patrolling but no door-knocker or bell.To those reporters he gave the story he had told himself for decades. He was not the killer of Che, not for sure. Yes, he was the man in the  photograph, who bore a strong resemblance to the officer at Che\u2019s laying-out (above) who stood behind his dead head, seeming to explain. He also had the same name as the man who had written a long-secret report on the killing to his superiors, and had been given Che\u2019s handmade pipe by an embedded  agent. But there were two other Mario Ter\u00e1ns in the Bolivian army, distinguished only by their maternal surnames: Mario Ter\u00e1n Ortu\u00f1o and Mario Ter\u00e1n Reque. As he told the reporters without blinking, it could well have been one of them.It was therefore not him for certain who, according to the secret report, entered the schoolhouse in La Higuera to find Che sitting on a bench. He said, \u201cYou\u2019ve come to kill me.\u201d To this his killer could only bow his head and make no answer. He was unable to fire. The figure of Che seemed suddenly gigantic. Those eyes shone so intensely that he felt dizzy, overwhelmed. He thought his  might be wrenched away by one movement of Che\u2019s hand. (The guards said later that he rushed from the building, soaked in sweat, and that he did so more than once.) At last Che said: \u201cCalm down and aim well! You are going to kill a man.\u201dThe man who was not him for certain aimed his carbine at Che\u2019s legs, recalling the order that he should do so to spread the official story that he had died of battle wounds. With the first burst he made him topple writhing to the ground, his legs destroyed and blood streaming across the floor. His killer regained his spirits then, and unleashed a second burst that found Che\u2019s arm, his shoulder and his heart. Then the giant was dead, and he left.Death in such a fashion, and especially the laying-out afterwards, mightily magnified the myth of Che.

After all, he had done much to consolidate his power. Following his election in 2019 he dissolved the legislature and filled the government with relatives and cronies.

After all, he had done much to consolidate his power. Following his election in 2019 he dissolved the legislature and filled the government with relatives and cronies. A thumping win for his coalition in parliamentary elections in 2020 enabled him to change the constitution, handing himself even more power.Yet over the past few weeks Mr Rajapaksa\u2019s hold on the country of 22m people has been slipping. Sri Lanka\u2019s economy is in free fall. The rupee has declined by more than 30% against the dollar since the central bank abandoned its peg a month ago (see chart). Fuel and food have been in short supply for weeks. Sri Lankans wait hours in the heat to buy cooking gas at \u2014if they can get it at all. Power cuts of up to 13 hours a day have crippled businesses, including the budding tech industry. Exams have been postponed for lack of paper. Hospitals across the country are running out of essential drugs. Even well-off Sri Lankans, usually insulated from such crises, have found themselves facing shortages.All this is a product of long-running economic imbalances, external shocks and government mismanagement. An earlier Rajapaksa government headed by Mahinda, Gotabaya\u2019s brother, borrowed heavily to finance infrastructure projects that have yet to generate returns. The current one slashed taxes, which bashed government revenue just before the pandemic halted tourist arrivals (a big source of foreign currency). It briefly banned fertiliser imports to save dollars, hitting food production.The government then delayed going to the  until March, hoping that returning tourists and help from China would tide it over. But just as tourism began to recover,  pushed up commodity prices yet again, making imported fuel and food dearer still.Economic hardship has driven people into the streets. Even middle-class types, who usually steer clear of protests and until recently approved of Mr Rajapaksa\u2019s brand of strongman ethno-nationalism, now put the blame for the crisis squarely on the president. \u201cThese are people who keep liquor cabinets at home, not those who come to politically-organised protests for a packet of rice and half a bottle of ,\u201d says Feroze Kamardeen, a playwright in Colombo.It has not helped that Mahinda\u2019s son (and minister of youth and sports), was spotted fly-boarding in the Maldives as Sri Lankans struggled to buy food. People are fed up. \u201cGo home Gota!\u201d\u2014the president\u2019s nickname\u2014read the signs mounted on everything from broomsticks to pets\u2019 collars. By \u201chome\u201d they mean America, where Mr Rajapaksa lived for several years.The government, failing to read the public mood, has responded with a mix of intimidation and ineptitude, producing a political crisis to compound the economic disaster. On April 1st Mr Rajapaksa, apparently spooked by demonstrations outside his home, declared a state of emergency. That gave the army wide-ranging powers to quell unrest. When this failed to dissuade protesters, he imposed a weekend-long curfew and a ban on social media. People returned to the streets anyway.On April 3rd the president changed tack. He restored social media and dismissed his cabinet, leaving only himself and Mahinda, now prime minister. The next day he lifted the curfew and named four new interim ministers, including a finance minister to replace another Rajapaksa brother who had previously held the job.Stability remains elusive. Ali Sabry, the new finance minister, resigned on April 5th after just 24 hours in the post. On the same day Mr Rajapaksa\u2019s coalition partners withdrew their support, leaving the government without a parliamentary majority. The president revoked the state of emergency a few hours later. Protesters still want the remaining Rajapaksas gone, but Gotabaya has given no indication that he will resign. The opposition has rejected his call to join an interim government. It seems reluctant to take charge in the middle of a crisis. Sri Lanka cannot afford to run a fresh election.The country must pay $7bn, roughly 9% of pre-crisis , in debt and interest payments, most of it dollar-denominated, by the end of the year. A $1bn bond payment is due in July. Sri Lanka\u2019s dollar reserves are nearly gone and it has had no access to global credit markets for two years. India has extended credit lines and assistance worth some $2.5bn, and has postponed payments on debt owed to its central bank.But Sri Lanka urgently needs a stay on other debt repayments to avoid a messy default. It will also need further lines of credit or aid\u2014perhaps through the World Bank\u2019s existing pandemic-relief mechanism\u2014to import food and fuel over the coming months while it negotiates how to restructure longer-term debt and regain access to bond markets.The lack of a stable government will make those discussions all the more difficult. Initial talks with the  began this week but official negotiations may be delayed until the president manages to appoint a new finance minister. Yet a bail-out by the fund is a crucial first step towards solving the crisis. Other creditors are unlikely to agree to new loans or the restructuring of existing ones without its backing.Things are not entirely hopeless. Both the decision to talk to the  and the appointment of P. Nandalal Weerasinghe, a respected economist who was due to take over as the new head of the central bank on April 7th, suggest that the government may have grasped the seriousness of the situation. Whether it can convince furious Sri Lankans that it deserves a chance to fix the mess is another question.

{"title": "China has a celebrated history of policy experiments", "content": "IN MAY 1919 John Dewey, an American philosopher, embarked on a lecture tour of China. \u201cWe are going to see more of the dangerous daring side of life here,\u201d he predicted. His celebration of learning by doing and social experimentation was enthusiastically received by the country\u2019s daring reformers and dangerous revolutionaries.

His celebration of learning by doing and social experimentation was enthusiastically received by the country\u2019s daring reformers and dangerous revolutionaries. At least one of his lectures was attended by a young schoolteacher called Mao Zedong. \u201cEverything through experimentation,\u201d Dewey declared on his tour. Chairman Mao would later repeat the line as China\u2019s ruler.In the scattered bases occupied by China\u2019s communists before 1949, experimentation was unavoidable, points out Sebastian Heilmann in his book, \u201cRed Swan: How Unorthodox Policymaking Facilitated China's Rise\u201d. The communists lacked the manpower or administrative reach to impose uniform policies. Instead they introduced new measures, such as land reform, in model villages or \u201cexperimental points\u201d, before spreading them across the \u201csurface\u201d of their territory. The aim was to learn by doing, without doing anything uncontainably calamitous. These \u201cmodel experiences\u201d, Mao wrote, were \u201cmuch closer to reality and richer than the decisions and directives issued by our leadership organs\u201d.A similar \u201cpoint-to-surface\u201d approach was embraced by China\u2019s leaders after Mao. Indeed, the central government has initiated over 630 such experiments since 1980, according to a recent paper by Shaoda Wang of the University of Chicago and David Yang of Harvard University. It has experimented with carbon trading, fisheries insurance, business licensing and fiscal devolution. A report last month by China\u2019s planning agency referred to pilot schemes covering everything from cross-border e-commerce and housing provident funds to green electricity and recyclable packaging.These trials are not mere formalities. The results can go either way. About 46% of experimental policies are never rolled out nationwide, according to Messrs Wang and Yang. An unsuccessful trial can nonetheless yield useful lessons for future reforms. Failure, as Mao once put it, is the mother of success: \u201ca fall into the pit\u201d can yield \u201ca gain in your wit\u201d.China has indeed gained a lot from using this method. It is a \u201chuge improvement\u201d on a \u201ccounterfactual world\u201d in which all central policies are implemented without any experimentation, Mr Wang argues. The point-to-surface technique is one reason why communist China has survived and advanced even as other socialist regimes have stagnated or collapsed, according to Mr Heilmann. Such unexpected outcomes are sometimes described as \u201cblack swans\u201d. In China\u2019s case, he argues, red seems the more appropriate colour.This long and celebrated history notwithstanding, China is surprisingly bad at policy experiments. Its trials are not as clean as they could be, skewing the conclusions its leaders draw. One problem is their location. According to China\u2019s planning agency, \u201csites should be fairly representative.\u201d But contrary to this sound advice, 80% of experiments since the 1980s have taken place in localities that are richer than average, according to Messrs Wang and Yang. Another bias is fiscal. When local authorities experiment with an area of policy, such as education or agriculture, they tend to spend 5% more money on that area than otherwise similar counties that are not taking part in the experiment.Experiments can also be skewed by less measurable factors. Some local officials, for example, simply put more effort into these pilot exercises than others. This is particularly true of ambitious young cadres who have more scope for promotion, because they are still far from retirement age. To measure this extra effort, Messrs Wang and Yang devise an ingenious proxy. They compare the language employed by local governments in describing the experiment. Leaders with more room for promotion differentiate their language from the boilerplate used by their upwardly immobile counterparts elsewhere.Extra effort, more spending and atypical prosperity can all skew the results of a policy experiment. Some of these biases may be well known to seasoned policymakers in Beijing. But if so, national leaders do not act as if they are aware of them. They tend to favour successful trials regardless of the true source of that success. The more prosperous an experimental site, the better the chance the policy will be adopted nationwide. Such backing is also more likely if the host county just happens to enjoy a fiscal windfall during the trial period, say because a fortuitous cut in interest rates raises land values. The central government does not seem to disentangle the merits of an innovative policy from the idiosyncrasies of the places that pilot it.This has national consequences. When new policies are spread across the surface of the country, the localities that most closely resemble the experimental \u201cpoints\u201d benefit the most, judged by their subsequent economic growth. Since experimental sites tend to be richer than average, the policies that emerge from experimentation may \u201csystematically favour\u201d the richer parts of China, Messrs Wang and Yang argue. That is not an outcome that Mao or Dewey would have welcomed: inequity through experimentation.How can China reform this engine of reform, moving its experiments closer to reality? Another striking calculation by the researchers suggests one useful place to start. They point out that local officials are 22% more likely to be promoted if they take part in a successful experiment. To improve this technique, therefore, China\u2019s leaders will have to fix the politics that attend it. In recent years, under Xi Jinping, experimentation has become \u201cforced and feigned\u201d, according to Mr Heilmann. Local administrators enjoy little \u201cleeway and they are fearful of making policy and ideological mistakes along the way\u201d. There will be no gain in wit if local policymakers fear a fall into the pit.

Not only can the doctor look up, say, how many centimetres shorter or taller the child is than the average for their age, but exactly what height percentile they fall into. Medical diagnoses can then be made based on an absolute comparison with the statistical norm.Reference charts are an important tool in modern primary medicine, covering many aspects of a person\u2019s healthy development. There is, however, a big gap in their coverage: the human brain. Richard Bethlehem and Simon White from the University of Cambridge and Jakob Seidlitz from the University of Pennsylvania want to fix that. Writing in , the neuroscientists describe the most comprehensive effort yet to create a standard against which someone\u2019s brain development can be measured through their lifetime.Their brain charts were compiled from more than 120,000 three-dimensional brain scans belonging to more than 100,000 patients who took part in more than 100 different research studies. The data set included people of all ages, ranging from babies still developing in the womb, just over 100 days after conception, to adults more than 100 years old.With that data, the scientists catalogued how the average human brain evolved from cradle to grave, focusing on three types of brain tissue: grey matter (made up of neuron cell bodies), white matter (the filaments connecting neurons) and tissue conveying cerebrospinal fluid (the brain\u2019s plumbing system). The scientists paid particular attention to the cerebral cortex, the outermost layer of the brain, responsible for higher-order brain functions. They observed grey matter in the cortex peaking in volume at 5.9 years, 2 to 3 years later than previously thought.Having characterised the development and ageing of the average human brain, the scientists modelled the distribution around it, charting the percentile-by-percentile variation in the structure of human brain tissue. This allowed them to investigate how the brains of patients with various developmental or degenerative disorders compare to more typical brains. \u201cOur investigation confirmed that Alzheimer\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment and schizophrenia show marked restructuring of brain tissue relative to a more typical brain of the same age and sex,\u201d says Dr Seidlitz.The catalogue turned up some surprises too. , for example, is generally thought to present differently in male and female patients, but there is little sign of that difference in their brain tissue. In contrast, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ()\u2014which presents similarly by sex\u2014displays the largest average difference in brain structure between male and female patients of any diagnosis they analysed. Over the course of a lifetime, the brains of male  patients appear to be skewed towards below-average volumes of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid. The brains of female  patients, on the other hand, were ever-so-slightly skewed towards higher volumes of the same tissues.What these differences in brain size mean is not yet clear. And the authors caution that their brain charts are not yet ready for clinical use, not least because the dataset they used has several limitations. \u201cUnfortunately, the data we compiled reflect the demographic biases of neuroscience research in general, ie, most studies are from Europe or North America, and over-represent patients of European ancestry,\u201d says Dr Bethlehem.To reflect the full diversity of normative human brain development, a more representative dataset will be required. Once that is accomplished, the utility of brain charts can begin to be tested in a clinical setting. One day, hopefully, these charts could become a useful tool in tracking a person\u2019s brain health or spotting the earliest physical signs of brain disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Susan Straight, a novelist born and brought up in Riverside, not far from Mecca, was shocked by these disparagements.

This is how Bill Hicks, a revered comedian who died in 1994, aged 32, riffed on the disorienting effect of watching cable news. Homelessness! Recession! Depression! The shocking headlines come at you relentlessly. But look out of the window and everything seems calm. The only sound is the chirping of crickets. You start to wonder, said Hicks: where is all this bad stuff happening?A lot of bad stuff is happening just now, most notably a war in Europe. There is also inflation and growing fears of recession. Government bonds have just had their worst quarter for returns in ages. The Treasury yield-curve has inverted: the gap between yields on ten- and two-year bonds recently turned negative, an early warning of a downturn. The Federal Reserve is growing more hawkish. Yet stocks are surprisingly buoyant. Even after a few days fairly deep in red ink this week, the & 500 index of stocks is only 7% below its all-time high. This might look like a foolish stockmarket failing to take its cue from a more realistic bond market. But the truth is more complicated.There are lots of plausible explanations for the resilience of stocks. An evergreen one is that there is no good alternative to owning them. Investors need to put money to work and American stocks are the least-worst option. Bonds are a snare. As long as inflation is expected to exceed interest rates, they are a sure-fire way to lose purchasing power. The yield on ten-year inflation-protected bonds is still negative even after the big repricing in bond markets. The earnings yield on equities is comfortably higher than this real bond yield. And stocks offer some protection against inflation in as much as corporate revenues are indexed to rising consumer prices.In any event, the risk of recession in America is not immediate. The Fed has barely started to tighten monetary policy. Even a rapid series of interest-rate increases will take time to slow the economy. The negative spread between ten- and two-year yields is an early-warning signal, not a blaring alarm. On average, recession hits more than a year after this part of the yield curve inverts. In the meantime, the equity market typically goes up. Looked at in this light, the message to take is to hold stocks for now.Underlying all these rationalisations is a sense that equity investors do not quite believe the Fed will follow through on all the interest-rate increases the bond market is pricing in. (Perhaps that is why the Fed\u2019s rate-setters are sounding more and more hawkish in public.) One strain of this belief gives the Fed too much credit: it says it can easily conquer inflation without crashing the economy. Another strain gives it too little credit: this school doubts the Fed\u2019s stomach to engineer a recession for the sake of price stability. If the result of such qualms is that inflation lingers above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for longer, then so be it. That would be a bigger problem for bond returns than for equities.It is possible to pick holes in all these arguments. But it is not quite right to conclude that the stockmarket has failed to adjust to new and harsher realities. The best-performing industries in the & 500 in the first quarter were those likely to be resilient to stagflation: energy, utilities and consumer staples. Meanwhile, technology stocks\u2014flag-bearers of the \u201csecular stagnation\u201d era of low inflation and low interest rates\u2014have had a brutal few months. The violence of this sector rotation away from tech has caused remarkably few ripples in the overall stockmarket. Nevertheless, equity investors were mindful of the world outside their window. The Bank of America\u2019s global fund-manager survey suggests that investors reduced the weighting of technology stocks in their portfolios as far back as November, notes Kevin Russell of  O\u2019Connor, the hedge-fund unit of the Swiss asset manager. The stockmarket has been ahead of the bond market on the risks of inflation, not behind it, he argues.A big question is how far all financial markets are running behind the reality of inflation. The phase during which asset prices adjust to the prospects of tighter Fed policy does not seem to have quite run its course. And the pattern of the past two years is for one market phase to give way quickly to another. Everything is moving faster these days. But the relentlessness of scary financial headlines is not a confection of the 24-hour news cycle. Instead it is a reflection of a super-charged business cycle, which looks set\u2014much like Bill Hicks\u2014to burn brightly and die young.:", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/09/bonds-signal-recession-stocks-have-been-buoyant-what-gives", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T13:34:57Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_fnd001.jpg"},

Classical-music enthusiasts were stunned. Less than a decade before, the maverick pianist had delighted fans with his authoritative recording of J.S. Bach\u2019s \u201cGoldberg Variations\u201d. Now, he declared, \u201cthe concert is dead\u201d. In 1965 he accepted a job with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation () and rode the Muskeg Express as far as it would go, from Winnipeg to Churchill, Manitoba.On the train, Gould struck up a conversation with Wally Maclean, a retired surveyor who combined a homespun folksiness with the soul of a philosopher. Over breakfast Maclean taught Gould how to read the signs of the icy land, to find \u201cin the most minute measurement a suggestion of the infinite\u201d. The cordial chat turned into a days-long, probing conversation.Gould adapted this material into \u201cThe Idea of North\u201d, a radio documentary exploring Canada\u2019s ambivalent relationship with its northern frontier, which the  aired in 1967. It was the first of three experimental audio documentaries he produced about choosing to live apart: \u201cThe Latecomers\u201d, about Newfoundland, was broadcast in 1969 and \u201cThe Quiet in the Land\u201d, which chronicles a Mennonite community, was released in 1977. Gould would later call the shows his \u201cSolitude Trilogy\u201d.The theme of isolation resonates again in the wake of the pandemic. What is more surprising is how fresh and experimental the programmes themselves sound, even in the high-tech, peak-podcast era. (They are available to stream via Spotify, Amazon and the \u2019s own website.) Take \u201cThe Idea of North\u201d, in which Gould arranged the voices of four main characters into a single fugue.

Some expect this year\u2019s Ramadan to explode into a confrontation between a frustrated, immiserated people and the country\u2019s brutal military regime. at sundown during Ramadan, which started on April 2nd, will not be the usual joyful family occasion for many Sudanese this year. The communal  will be blighted by the shortage, and spiralling cost, of wheat and other basics. Some expect this year\u2019s Ramadan to explode into a confrontation between a frustrated, immiserated people and the country\u2019s brutal military regime.Few Sudanese can remember a time when their country was in such a bleak state. The currency is in free fall, having plunged by more than a quarter since October. Inflation is officially 260%, but probably even higher. Some 9m people (out of a population of about 44m) face \u201cacute hunger\u201d, says the \u2019s World Food Programme, and this number could double by September. Khartoum, the capital, is rocked by daily anti-regime protests and the often-violent response of the security forces, who have killed about 90 people over the past five months (see chart).Blame this mess on a military coup led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in October, which reversed Sudan\u2019s fragile transition to democracy. This had started three years ago after protesters took to the streets to eject Omar al-Bashir, a ruthless Islamist despot who had ruled the country for 30 years. As he was about to fall in April 2019, the army seized power, hoping to keep its grip on politics and the economy. But demonstrations and international pressure pushed the generals into a pact with the leaders of the protests, whereby they promised to hand control to civilians by 2021 ahead of elections that were due to take place this year.Western donors and multilateral banks pledged tens of billions of dollars in assistance and debt relief to support the democratic transition. But the second coup in October has stopped much of that help from reaching Sudan, or delayed it. America, the World Bank and the  have halted the flow of at least $1.4bn in aid and assistance. The junta, running short of funds, has cut the once generous subsidies it lavished on wheat and fuel. But it is doing so without the Western aid-funded safety nets that were meant to cushion the blow to the country\u2019s poor. They are furious; more protests are likely.All these woes have been compounded by Vladimir Putin\u2019s war. More than 80% of Sudan\u2019s wheat imports come from Russia and Ukraine, and the conflict has already interrupted supplies. Last month the local price of wheat rose above $550 a tonne, an increase of 180% compared with a year ago.The generals running the country, meanwhile, are desperate for cash to keep the government functioning. To plug holes in the budget they are increasing taxes on businesses. This looks like wishful thinking, since few businesses pay much tax at all, says Kholood Khair, an analyst in Khartoum; many are struggling to survive. More notably and more opaquely, the generals have gone begging for funds from countries that used to back the old regime. They may be hawking Sudan\u2019s few remaining assets in exchange.General Burhan recently visited the United Arab Emirates () to get pledges of support for Sudan\u2019s banks and currency, as well as investment in unspecified \u201cdevelopment projects\u201d. One of these may involve  World, the \u2019s port operator, which for years has had its eye on Sudan\u2019s main container terminal at Port Sudan on the Red Sea. But workers at the port bitterly oppose privatisation, fearing it may lead to job losses. An earlier attempt to bring in a Philippine port operator was scuppered after workers went on strike and paralysed the port, which handles 90% of Sudan\u2019s inter national trade.The generals are also cosying up to Russia. It has long coveted a naval base on the Red Sea and is also a keen buyer of Sudan\u2019s gold. Both topics were probably on the agenda when the deputy head of Sudan\u2019s junta, Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo (better known as Hemedti), visited Russia on the eve of its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Dagalo heads the Rapid Support Forces (), a vicious paramilitary outfit that controls many of Sudan\u2019s illicit gold mines. He is thought to be the regime\u2019s link to , a Russian mercenary outfit that Western diplomats accuse of involvement in the illicit gold mines. Sudan\u2019s government denies it.The timing of Mr Dagalo\u2019s visit to Moscow cannot have been a coincidence. Russia needs more of Sudan\u2019s gold to buttress its economy against Western sanctions. Gold accounts for about 40% of Sudan\u2019s exports and is thought to be smuggled out of the country via the  and then on to Russia. This may help explain why both the  and Sudan abstained on the  vote condemning Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. On his return from Moscow, Mr Dagalo said he had \u201cno problem\u201d with Russia opening a naval base in Sudan and that the country presents a \u201cgreat opportunity for Russian investments\u201d.Yet such desperate dealmaking may not buy the regime stability. Mr Dagalo\u2019s deepening ties to Russia are exacerbating tensions between him and General Burhan. And they are fuelling anger among the protesters, who believe Russia supported the coup last year.The generals need to worry not only about protests in the capital but also about rising violence in the western region of Darfur, where government forces and the Janjaweed, a militia that is now part of the , committed genocide in 2003. This week a suspected leader of the Janjaweed appeared at the International Criminal Court in The Hague to face charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the court\u2019s first case relating to conflict in Darfur. Yet the prospect of justice is not bringing peace. Last month at least 48 people were killed in clashes in the area.When Sudanese rose up three years ago to topple their genocidal dictator, they hoped to build democracy and prosperity. Instead, after two coups they face a political crisis, a shrinking economy and a rise in violence. These threaten the \u201cvery existence\u201d of Sudan, said Volker Perthes, the \u2019s special representative to the Horn of Africa. \u201cUnless the current trajectory is corrected,\u201d he told the  Security Council last month, \u201cthe country will head towards an economic and security collapse, and significant humanitarian suffering.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2022/04/09/sudan-faces-collapse-three-years-after-the-fall-of-its-dictator", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T11:00:00Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20220409_MAP001_0.jpg"},

Some of the most appealing s in Europe are either made in China (Tesla) or by Chinese-owned firms (). Given concerns about the decoupling of trade into ideological blocs, should that be a dieselgate-sized worry?To answer that question, first examine what is known in China as \u201cthe catfish effect\u201d, the idea that a predator makes weaker rivals swim faster. For years China led the world in production and purchase of s. However, the cars were heavily subsidised and shoddy. They were a response to the government\u2019s desire to scrub the air and leapfrog the internal-combustion engine, a technology in which China was a laggard. Delighting customers was an afterthought. No Chinese -maker was as world-beating as Huawei became in smartphones\u2014before America blackballed it in 2019.That same year Tesla set up shop in Shanghai and began rolling Model 3s off the production line. It became, says Gregor Sebastian of the Mercator Institute for China Studies in Berlin, the epitome of a catfish. The effect was similar to the benefit that production of Apple\u2019s iPhone in China brought to the country\u2019s smartphone market, where local suppliers had to raise their game to meet international standards. Chinese carmakers\u2019 ambitions likewise rose. The result has been an accelerated shift towards electrification. , a battery manufacturer turned China\u2019s biggest seller of s and hybrids, said on April 4th that it had ceased making full combustion-engine vehicles. As with Tesla, its sales are booming.As yet, no Chinese -maker is an export powerhouse. Stockmarket analysts are playing up the potential, hoping this will bring Tesla-like valuations, says Tu Le of Sino Auto Insights, a consultancy. But most of China\u2019s  exports are by wholly foreign brands, such as Tesla, or those with Chinese partners, such as . Foreign marques account for most of the 296,000 Chinese-made s and plug-in hybrids sold abroad last year\u2014more than quadruple the number in 2020. Because of high American tariffs, the favourite destinations are Europe and South-East Asia.China\u2019s biggest  firms are adopting a variety of export strategies to catch up. , a state-owned car company, is making inroads in Europe under the cover of , a classic British sports-car brand that it bought in 2007. It keeps its Chinese identity hidden behind the alluring octagonal nameplate, which may be why sales hit more than 52,000 in Europe last year, double the year before, many of which were . , as well as Nio, which hopes to take on luxury marques like Mercedes, have made -friendly Norway the springboard for their forays into Europe. In South-East Asia the strategy is to \u201cattack the villages to surround the cities\u201d, says Scott Kennedy of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank in Washington. That means selling low-cost s where Western companies do not venture, in order to strengthen supply chains. Taxi fleets are a popular target for firms like .Until recently it was considered a long shot that such low-cost brands could penetrate developed markets as well as developing ones. The  market in China includes scores of also-rans and it begs for consolidation. The firms lack the overseas sales networks of global rivals. Yet they have their own built-in advantages, including access to the best battery supply in the world and in some cases more sophisticated software than European rivals. China is also taking international safety standards more seriously.If its -makers thrive, it would be good for more than just the car market. The more high-quality Chinese products appeal to international consumers, the more of a stake China has in preserving global trade. s encompass many of the strategic tensions that burden the trading system. They are heavily reliant on semiconductors, which has become a sore point in China, and on batteries, Chinese dominance of which is a bugbear for the West. They are hugely subsidised. The harvesting of personal information to improve traffic routes, charging and self-driving technology raises thorny questions about privacy, data storage and cyber-security. The  industry is also exposed to trade wars: since 2018 America has levied 25% tariffs on Chinese battery cells, electric motors and other  components. The European Union, with its green agenda, is less overtly protectionist for once.Most Western carmakers have enough of a stake in keeping supply chains open, and in maintaining access to China\u2019s own market, that they would prefer not to erect more trade barriers. They know, however, that China is using them as catfish to improve its own industry. At any point it could decide that they have done their job. That could throw the entire global market, including China\u2019s, into turmoil.Yet the catfish effect can work in both directions. Last month Bloomberg reported that , China\u2019s battery behemoth, was considering building a $5bn factory in North America. In response Jim Greenberger of Batt International, a battery trade body, said he would welcome this as long as  brought battery-manufacturing tech and know-how in order to foster technology transfer to American firms.That, of course, is the magic of globalisation. Over time, competition and co-operation lead to the exchange of ideas, benefiting all. It will not last if geopolitical tensions, heightened by Russia\u2019s pounding of Ukraine, splinter the world economy into competing blocs.

Decisions made this year could determine whether that target is met or whether the world overshoots it by the middle of this century and has to deal with severe climate extremes before attempting to turn the thermostat back down in the second half of the century.These are the warnings delivered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change () in the third volume of its latest assessment report, published on April 4th. It follows earlier tomes, published in recent months, that first laid out the current state of knowledge on the physical science of climate change and then examined the impacts of warming on the human and natural worlds.The third report offers a comprehensive menu of possibilities for how humans could stabilise the climate and avoid catastrophic global warming while fulfilling the commitments made in the 2015 Paris agreement. The aim of that pact was to keep average global warming to between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.The \u2019s menu includes options for power generation and energy efficiency, transport, buildings, urbanisation, agriculture and food security, forestry, consumer choices and much more besides. Its 278 authors have gone to great pains to offer a smorgasbord of opportunities to reduce emissions and stabilise the climate, and to point out that not all are eye-wateringly expensive.There is just one catch. In order to meet the Paris goals, humanity must order just about everything on the menu, and fast.\u201cWe need to get on with this now or [the goal of] 1.5\u00b0C will slip beyond reach,\u201d declared the report\u2019s co-chair, Jim Skea of Imperial College London, when it was published. \u201cIf there is no advance in the kind of pledges that countries are making before we get to  in Egypt,\u201d he added, referring to the next  climate summit, scheduled for November, \u201cwe may well have to conclude that 1.5\u00b0C has indeed gone.\u201dClimate scientists are typically reluctant to admit defeat when it comes to this target, in part because research collated in another  report in 2018 showed that the consequences of 2\u00b0C of global warming were considerably worse than 1.5\u00b0C, particularly for the poorest parts of the world and low-lying regions that are vulnerable to rising seas and destructive storm surges. But the measures they show to be necessary in order to meet the target are so stringent that overshooting 1.5\u00b0C of warming now seems all but certain.The physics of the global climate system, however, leaves little room for prevarication, and Dr Skea\u2019s stark warning comes directly as a result of the numbers in the latest report. The \u201ccarbon budget\u201d represents the total amount of carbon dioxide that can still be pumped into the atmosphere before a certain amount of warming is likely. For example, the  says that for a 50% chance of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, no more than 500bn tonnes of CO can be emitted beyond 2020, equivalent to little more than a decade of emissions at current rates.The report says that to avoid more than 1.5\u00b0C of warming, global emissions must peak before 2025 and then fall by 43% before 2030, compared with 2019 levels. Yet human societies emit more greenhouse gases with every passing decade, and the last one saw the largest rise in emissions in human history. While the report\u2019s socioeconomic simulations of the coming decades show that it is theoretically possible to cut emissions by the amounts needed, the political realities and inherent inertia of economies that are largely structured around fossil fuels make the transition challenging, particularly at the speed that is now required.Achieving the 1.5\u00b0C Paris goal means that global use of coal must decline by 95% by 2050, relative to 2019. Oil use must drop by 60% and gas by 45% in that period. The decreases needed to limit warming to below 2\u00b0C are not much lower. Under all scenarios, there is no room for new unabated fossil-fuel projects (such as power plants), and most existing ones will have to be wound down faster than they would have otherwise. \u201cEstimated emissions from the current [fossil-fuel] infrastructure over planned lifetimes are roughly what we can emit for a 2\u00b0C scenario,\u201d said Michael Grubb of University College London, one of the  report\u2019s authors.Keeping warming to less than 2\u00b0C would therefore mean shortening the lifespans of existing fossil-fuel power stations and refineries. These could be retrofitted with installations that capture warming gases before they escape into the atmosphere in order to store them underground or beneath the oceans. But, as the report\u2019s authors note, governments and business have promised to develop such an industry (dubbed \u201ccarbon capture and storage\u201d) for decades, but failed to do so.Among the darker warnings, there are some shafts of light. The cost of solar energy dropped by 85% during the 2010s, and wind power by 55%. During the same period, the market for electric vehicles grew a hundredfold. The  report notes that at least 24 countries have consistently cut emissions for at least a decade. Despite worrying trends in the Brazilian Amazon, there is more forest cover and less deforestation today than in 2010. In 2020 more than 20% of global emissions were covered by carbon taxes or trading schemes. And also in 2020, more than 50 countries, accounting for more than half of global emissions, had enacted climate laws intended to reduce emissions.The energy intensity of the global economy (a measure of the amount of energy expended to generate one unit of ) decreased by 2% per year between 2010 and 2019. At the same time, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted for each unit of energy produced (known as \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d) decreased\u2014an indication that, globally, energy is becoming greener.But these gains are nowhere near what models say will be needed to stabilise the climate before it is too late. Carbon intensity, for instance, declined by 0.3% per year in the 2010s, a fraction of the 3.5% per year that the models say is needed to give a good chance of limiting warming to 2\u00b0C. For a 1.5\u00b0C goal, the annual improvement would have to be 7.7%.One common thread running through the Paris-compliant scenarios presented by the  is the inclusion of options for removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. That is because all scenarios assume that there will be residual emissions from some economic sectors come mid-century, even under the most optimistic assumptions. Viable options for eliminating fossil fuels from aviation and heavy industry are currently lacking, and few envisage a sufficient change in this over the coming decades.Options for removing these residual emissions broadly come in two types: the ecological (reforestation, ecosystem restoration, schemes to increase the amount of carbon sequestered in agricultural soils) and the chemical (using minerals or reagents that selectively bind to atmospheric CO and allow it to be stored underground, underwater or in solid form).The former appears easy and cheap but is potentially unreliable. Forests burn and release greenhouse gases as they do; in a warmer, drier world, they will burn more. To be long-term stores of carbon, trees must be managed and protected, something that humans in general do not always do well. Ecological solutions can also compete for land with agriculture, particularly at the kinds of scales required by the climate models.On the other hand, technological solutions for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are in their infancy and extremely expensive. The two companies that have commercial operations offer to remove one tonne of carbon dioxide for between $300 and $1,000. For comparison, a single economy seat on a return flight from London to San Francisco is responsible for just under one tonne of emissions.These carbon-removal technologies may see a rapid drop in costs. Proponents point to the recent successes of solar- and wind-energy projects\u2014all three technologies involve small modular components, making them relatively easy to scale up, and fans of the \u201cdirect air capture\u201d industry have used the similarities to suggest that their technology will also take off quickly. Still, it is worth noting that even solar energy, a modern-day darling of the green-energy world, took several decades to get where it is today.To some, the calls to end the age of fossil fuels or face the consequences of letting the world burn may seem divorced from immediate reality, particularly as European countries desperately seek gas to replace Russian supplies and stave off fuel shortages and crippling prices during the next winter.But there are some synergies between the two crises. In the long list of options for reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency in transport, buildings and industry is low-hanging fruit, as are behavioural changes such as switching from private vehicles to public transport. Encouraging consumers to decrease energy demand in this way would also increase energy security. And every fraction of a degree shaved off future warming reduces climate risks, even if the 1.5\u00b0C target is missed.The covid-19 pandemic presented an opportunity to use the resulting economic turmoil to stimulate green growth. The response of governments was patchy at best. Today, as the West comes to grips with a deepening energy crisis, it faces a similar challenge, but with added urgency in light of the latest climate warnings from the \u2019s scientists.

In 2020 their rate of opioid-related deaths surpassed white people\u2019s\u2014the culmination of a grim trend some five years in the making.The first wave of the epidemic was caused by drug companies and doctors pushing prescription opioids. Researchers theorise that twisted beliefs (that African-Americans are more likely to divert pills for street use, and are less sensitive to pain so do not need them anyway) helped to insulate them from the scourge relative to white Americans. Then, from 2010, came a second wave: as regulators clamped down on prescription pills, many addicts turned to illicit opioids, notably heroin. White addicts continued to fatally overdose at over twice the rate of black users.Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times more potent than heroin, brought a third wave. Though it is also a prescription painkiller, its illicit form\u2014mainly made in Mexico with materials from China\u2014has contaminated drugs. Its low cost and powerful high make it attractive: dealers can dilute the more expensive drugs they sell, such as cocaine, heroin or methamphetamine, while strengthening their effect.Especially so for older black men. In 2020 black men aged 55 to 64 died at over 2.5 times the rate of older white men. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of opioid-policy research at Brandeis University, describes some of these victims as survivors of the heroin epidemic that devastated inner cities in the 1960s and 70s. Unaware that a more powerful synthetic opioid had contaminated their supply, \u201colder black men who managed to beat the odds and survive for decades started dying,\u201d explains Dr Kolodny.George (not his real name), a 55-year-old West Baltimore native, has struggled with addiction since he was a teenager. In the four decades since he was first handed powdered heroin wrapped in a dollar bill the landscape has changed: \u201cYou used to be able to get a quality bag of heroin. Now you have this synthetic drug out here on the streets everywhere.\u201d He now uses fentanyl regularly and estimates he has overdosed on it four times in the past couple of years. \u201cWhen you\u2019re messing with this stuff, everything\u2019s a blur,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I keep outliving people, but I really don\u2019t want to leave this Earth an addict.\u201dThe poison has crept into stimulants, too. Overdose deaths attributed to psycho stimulants used with opioids have risen. Some are referring to this as a fourth wave of the epidemic. For those unaccustomed to opioids or \u201cspeedballing\u201d (mixing stimulants with opioids), fentanyl is \u201ca shock to the system, shutting down your breathing and heart rate\u201d, says Keith Humphreys, a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. Some 35% of African-Americans who died of overdoses in 2020 had both cocaine and fentanyl in their system, compared with 16% of white victims.Poor people are more than twice as likely to die of opioid overdose. One-fifth of African-Americans live in poverty. Fully 40% of all homeless people and 38% of prisoners are black (compared with just 13% of the overall population). These are all potent risk factors. And though an estimated 65% of America\u2019s prisoners suffer from a substance-use disorder of some sort, there is little access to good treatment either during incarceration or upon release.Treatment for opioid use disorder () is woefully inadequate across the country, but African-Americans often face extra barriers. Studies have found that medications for treating  as well as naloxone (a life-saving medication that reverses opioid overdoses), are doled out unevenly. A study of data from Medicaid, the government insurance programme for the poor, across several states with some of the highest opioid-overdose rates found that between 2014 and 2018 black people with  were 28% less likely to use  medications.Studies in various cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, suggest that African-Americans have less access to naloxone, too. In Detroit between 2019 and 2020, white addicts received 28% of naloxone administrations, though they accounted for 17% of the city\u2019s opioid overdoses; although 80% of overdoses were among black people, they received only 67% of naloxone administrations. This does not necessarily mean black addicts are being denied naloxone. Those who use opioids alone, are homeless or live in communities with little trust in first responders might be less likely to call for help.Such disparities strengthen the case for local interventions that deal with the unique hurdles certain communities face. Other solutions are more sweeping, like expanding access to Medicaid and reducing red tape around  medications. But underlying all these is a straightforward calculus that applies to all Americans, black or white: \u201cIt has to be easier to get treated than it is to continue using,\u201d says Dr Kolodny. \u201cYou have to flip it.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/04/09/black-americans-have-overtaken-white-victims-in-opioid-death-rates", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T15:38:00Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": null},

As Apple\u2019s then-boss gave his presentation, his audience slowly realised that the three products were in fact a single gadget: the iPhone. Cue applause, cue Apple\u2019s renaissance, and cue a new era in technology as the smartphone overtook the desktop  as the centre of personal computing.Today even Mr Jobs might be surprised by how many uses have been found for his versatile device. The small screen has come to handle banking, networking, map-reading, gaming and much more. Apple and other phonemakers have been enriched not only by hardware sales (worth $530bn last year) but by controlling what happens on the platform, from app stores (which raked in $135bn) to mobile ads (worth nearly $300bn).Yet there is mounting evidence that the smartphone era is fading. Phone sales have been in gentle decline since 2016, as slower technological improvement has led to people upgrading less often. In rich countries, already saturated, the decline is especially marked. So tech innovators and investors are on the hunt for the next big thing, in hopes of winning not just a juicy hardware market but the potential to control the platform on which everything takes place.The current big idea is virtual-reality () headsets, spurred on in part by pandemic lockdowns. More promising, but further off, are glasses for experiencing augmented reality (), in which computer graphics are overlaid on the real world. Most of America\u2019s big tech firms\u2014among them Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft\u2014as well as Asian giants like ByteDance (TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner) and Sony, are developing or already selling . What has so far been a niche market is about to become very crowded.Any claim to have discovered the next big platform deserves caution. There have been plenty of false starts. Tablets were proclaimed as a rival to the smartphone, yet Apple still makes six times as much money selling iPhones as it does from iPads. Smart homes were seen as another possible mega-platform, but so far Alexa and her like serve mostly as jukeboxes and egg-timers. In-car tech is another platform that has proved useful and valuable, but hardly threatens to become the centre of anyone\u2019s digital life. It is easy to imagine headsets, which are now used mostly for gaming, getting stuck in a similar niche.What does seem to be under way, however, is a gradual movement by consumers towards a constellation of new wearable devices. These include voice-activated smart headphones, which can make calls, read messages and more, and smart watches, which handle scheduling, navigation and fitness. A growing array of health-tech gadgets measure everything from blood sugar to sleep patterns. In America unit sales of these \u201cwearables\u201d are already close to sales of smartphones.These gadgets are more like accessories for the phone than replacements. But as computing shifts away from the pocket and towards wrists and ears, a growing share of consumers\u2019 attention and spending is seeping away from the phone, too. As  and  glasses become lighter and cheaper, they could form the most powerful part of the wearable cluster.People are not about to ditch their phones, any more than they threw out their laptops a decade ago. But as they interact more often with earphones or, soon, glasses, more of them will come to use their phone as a kind of back office, primarily there to provide processing muscle for other gadgets. As chips get even smaller, phones may not be needed even for that.Don\u2019t expect any of this to happen right away. Internet-enabled phones were launched in the late 1990s and failed to catch on outside offices.  headsets\u2014bulky, pricey and so far used only in industry\u2014are at a similar stage. Yet when technological tipping-points are crossed, things can change fast. Four years after Mr Jobs introduced his iPhone, smartphones outsold all laptop and desktop computers worldwide. Silicon Valley\u2019s latest great hope is still a work in progress. But if and when the right product appears, the future may arrive very quickly.

For many Brazilians, it will be a moment to savour. The last time Lula held office, from 2003 to 2010, his welfare programmes lifted millions out of poverty. His gruff charisma charmed Barack Obama, then the president of the United States, who called Lula \u201cthe most popular politician on Earth\u201d. When he left the presidential palace, with 11 trucks packed with gifts from well-wishers, his approval rating was 80%. As Brazilians reel from a poorly handled pandemic and stubborn inflation, it is not surprising that Lula leads Jair Bolsonaro, the populist incumbent, by double digits in most polls.Yet opponents prefer another superlative for the ex-president. He is \u201cthe biggest corruptor in Brazilian history\u201d, Ciro Gomes, a centre-left foe, said last year. Mr Bolsonaro and his son Fl\u00e1vio, a senator, who are themselves mired in allegations of graft, refer to him as \u201cthe nine-fingered thief\u201d (as a young man, Lula lost a finger in a factory accident). Rivals will not want voters to forget that Lula was handed a 12-year sentence on charges of money-laundering and corruption, and watched the previous election from prison.Ahead of elections in October, these two narratives jostle for supremacy. Most supporters of his Workers\u2019 Party, the , believe him when he says he was the innocent victim of a conspiracy to prevent his return to politics. Many in the business elite believe he is a crook. The truth is murkier and, like corruption in Brazil more generally, maddeningly complex.Start with the process that brought Lula down: the \u201ccar wash\u201d scandal, or Lava Jato. What began in 2014 as an operation to catch small-time currency dealers above a petrol station soon reached further than anyone could have imagined. It revealed that companies had been bribing politicians in exchange for huge contracts, exposing systemic corruption.The public were furious. The probe entangled hundreds of businessmen and politicians. It extended to 11 countries and touched a dozen current or former Latin American heads of state, including Lula. He was convicted of accepting bribes in the form of a beachfront apartment and renovations on a country house, neither of which he owned. In an investigation which recouped over $5bn in stolen money, there were far more \u201cvulgar\u201d and \u201cflagrant\u201d crimes, notes one Lava Jato prosecutor. But Lula was its biggest fish.Then the net ripped. A series of blunders had already undermined Lava Jato, which had long stretched beyond its capacities. Leaked messages released by the Intercept, an investigative website, revealed that Sergio Moro, the judge, had been collaborating with Deltan Dallagnol, the prosecutor, against Lula. Mr Moro\u2019s impartiality had already been thrown into question when he became Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s justice minister. \u201cThe ex-president was a victim of a manhunt,\u201d says Cristiano Zanin Martins, Lula\u2019s lawyer.The Supreme Court agreed. Last year it ruled that Mr Moro had been biased, weeks after a justice had annulled Lula\u2019s convictions. All in all, two dozen cases against Lula and his family have been archived, suspended or closed\u2014because of tainted evidence, procedural errors or technicalities. Lula, who has always denied all charges, seems vindicated. \u201cI was wronged. I've already proved my innocence,\u201d he told last year.Not all are convinced. A survey in February found that 51% of all of those asked, and 22% of those who had voted for the , did not believe that the archiving of one of the cases against Lula proved his innocence. His lawyers say this is because of a \u201ctrial by media\u201d. Critics say that he has not been absolved. \u201cEverything archived, nothing cleared up\u201d, read a recent headline in one Brazilian weekly.Consider the case of the Swedish planes. One of Lula\u2019s sons received 2.5m reais ($740,000) from a lobbyist, ostensibly to promote American football. That lobbyist was at the same time working for a Swedish plane-maker which went on to win a controversial tender for new fighter jets. Prosecutors accused Lula, who had left office at this point, of influencing his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and successor Dilma Rousseff to agree to the deal. On March 2nd it became the last case against Lula to be shelved, because of tainted evidence.Another case involved a country house in Atibaia owned by business partners of another one of Lula\u2019s sons. Odebrecht, a construction company, claimed it paid to renovate it. Testimonies and court documents placed Lula and his belongings at the site. Someone at the institute which bears Lula\u2019s name received updates by email about maintenance issues, skunk-traps and peacock chicks. Yet despite what was presented in the trial, Mr Moro had not received enough evidence to justify opening the case in the first place, said the Supreme Court justice who refused to reopen proceedings. Other cases could be revived by the federal court, but that would take years. Final judgment will probably come from a historical study, not a court ruling.Critics have a second, graver complaint about Lula: that he presided over systemic corruption. During his first term in office the  illegally used public money to pay politicians a , or monthly stipend, in return for support of its programme. The policies they enacted helped many Brazilians, but at a high moral cost.Lava Jato also showed that under the  state-owned companies routinely awarded padded contracts to corrupt firms, mostly Odebrecht. Malu Gaspar, a journalist who has written a book about the firm, describes how Marcelo Odebrecht, its , asked the department of \u201cStructured Operations\u201d (or the specialist bribery team) to tot up its  \u201cdonations\u201d. In the final two years of Lula\u2019s government, these payments amounted to 200m reais (around $115m in 2010).Lula has always maintained that he did not know about either the policy of or the Odebrecht payments. But two of his chiefs of staff, Antonio Palocci and Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, were at the heart of both scandals. In public, Lula decried Odebrecht as a \u201ccriminal organisation\u201d. However on the company\u2019s spreadsheet of colourful code names, their accountants called him \u201cAmigo\u201d; after he left office he toured Africa and Latin America on their dime.But it would be \u201cvery inaccurate\u201d to say that only the  behaved in this way, says Caio Rodriguez, Odebrecht\u2019s lead counsel during Lava Jato. The investigation mainly focused on them because they were in the federal government. But he notes that, in terms of quantity, the bribes Odebrecht gave at a state level to the main opposition group, the Party of Brazilian Social Democracy, were roughly the same. In terms of the numbers of legislators investigated, the grubbiest was one of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s old parties, the Progressive Party, not the . Historically, too, \u201cthere is no difference\u201d between the  and previous governments, says Fernando Limongi, a sociologist. It was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.If Lula wins, will it be different this time? A lot will depend on how much Lava Jato has disrupted the usual state of affairs. One significant change is that firms that bribe politicians now face crippling legal and financial punishments if they are caught. That may deter future wrongdoing.Yet despite the headlines, Lava Jato did not end impunity in Brazil. It investigated and prosecuted individuals, partly by using similar methods to American anti-corruption task-forces, such as plea bargaining. But it was unable to root out a culture of corruption. The powerful fought back. Blunders and lapses by prosecutors, including Mr Moro, have led to hundreds of convictions being overturned. Political meddling in the investigation has weakened trust in the justice system. Bribery and embezzlement continue, and the public no longer care as much as they did. Corruption was for years the number one issue for voters; surveys now rank it fifth or sixth. With inflation at 11%, they have other problems to worry about.And although Mr Bolsonaro came to power promising to vanquish graft, he has quietly capitalised on the backlash against Lava Jato. The president has hobbled key institutions which fight against corruption, replacing their leaders and reducing their powers. He fired the head of the federal police. Mr Moro says this was to stop an investigation into his sons. Mr Bolsonaro denies it. Mr Moro quit as justice minister in protest. Finally, by creating a \u201csecret budget\u201d, Mr Bolsonaro has served up millions of dollars in pork to some of the dirtiest members of Congress. In 2020 he announced the end of Lava Jato for good.Anti-corruption efforts are now weaker than they have been for years, says Bruno Brand\u00e3o of Transparency International Brazil, a watchdog that championed Lava Jato. Lula may try to reverse this decline, reckons Silvana Batini, who was on the Lava Jato task force in Rio de Janeiro. As president\u2014and unlike Mr Bolsonaro\u2014Lula appointed a prosecutor-general from a non-partisan shortlist. He strengthened the federal police. After huge protests in 2013 Ms Rousseff introduced the law which laid the foundations for Lava Jato. Despite the corruption within its own ranks, the  bolstered the institutions that eventually brought them down.Lula is unlikely to give a nuanced explanation of all this to voters, let alone a . Instead he is suing people. On March 22nd he won damages from Mr Dallagnol, the prosecutor in the leaked memos, for a defamatory PowerPoint the latter had presented before any case had been opened. Lula\u2019s lawyers called the compensation \u201ca symbol of the historical reparation that is due\u201d. Their client called his accusers \u201cmessianic brats\u201d. Three other cases against detractors are pending.On March 31st Mr Moro, who pitched himself as a \u201cthird way\u201d candidate for the presidency, announced he would suspend his campaign. A few days later, he seemed to change his mind. Such indecision increases the likelihood of a showdown between Lula and Mr Bolsonaro, and also of a tighter race. It is a contest which will make strange bedfellows. Before Mr Bolsonaro became president, Geraldo Alckmin, the former governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, said that Lula returning to power would mean going back \u201cto the scene of the crime\u201d. Now Mr Alckmin is expected to be Lula\u2019s running mate. His volte-face may smack of opportunism. But in October many Brazilians may end up making a similar choice.

War profiteers and smugglers have moved in.Like those other fine cities of the Middle East\u2014Aleppo, Mosul and Raqqa\u2014Benghazi was sacked in order to wrest it from Islamist rule. For three years Khalifa al-Haftar, a former general turned warlord who commands the self-styled Libyan National Army (), shelled this capital of Libya\u2019s eastern region (once called Cyrenaica) from land, sea and air, until it fell to him in late 2017.

However, Libya\u2019s power brokers in Tripoli, the country\u2019s capital in the west, are preoccupied with arguing over oil revenues and who should be prime minister. \u201cThere\u2019s no real will to rebuild our city,\u201d laments Atif al-Hasiya, a Benghazi engineer.Mr Haftar nonetheless promotes himself as its protector. \u201cWith one hand we build, with the other fight terror,\u201d reads a slogan on a sheet flapping in the wind along the corniche. Locals speak only of the terror, inflicted mainly by Mr Haftar\u2019s men, and say he squanders funds on military ventures and salaries for his fighters, who claim to number 127,000.

Last May he unveiled a reconstruction package that included the city. He was likened by optimists to Rafiq al-Hariri, the Lebanese tycoon who used his own company to rebuild Beirut after its civil war (before he was assassinated). Various unfinished projects, such as an Olympic stadium that Mr Dbeibeh had overseen under Qaddafi, might possibly be completed. But Mr Haftar\u2019s gunmen barred Mr Dbeibeh from visiting their stronghold, and the funds never materialised.

Will the libertarian troll push to bring back Donald Trump, kicked off the platform after inciting an assault on the Capitol in January 2021? Speculation mounted after Twitter said a day later that Mr Musk would join its board.As is his wont, Mr Musk will reveal his plans in his own time and probably in his own tweets to the 80m people who follow him on the platform (not many fewer than followed Mr Trump before he got the boot). In posts published before he announced the investment, he complained that Twitter \u201cserves as the de facto public town square\u201d but fails \u201cto adhere to free-speech principles\u201d. He urged the company to open up the algorithm that decides which tweets users see. In light of his well-documented sympathies for cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, the blockchain, he could try to turn Twitter into a decentralised service controlled by users.It is hard to see how that would make the company more profitable. Investors rejoiced anyway. Some may be believers in the \u201cElon markets hypothesis\u201d, which holds that stocks should be valued based not on fundamentals but on their proximity to Mr Musk. Others may hope that he can really shake things up.  has been a much bigger cultural success than a commercial one. Before Mr Musk\u2019s move sent its share price up by a third, the firm\u2019s market value had been languishing around $30bn, not much higher than where it was when it went public in 2013. By comparison, its social-media rival Meta (n\u00e9e Facebook), briefly became a $1trn company and its market capitalisation is up more than five-fold in the same period despite a recent tumble (it is currently worth $631bn).Whatever Mr Musk\u2019s designs for Twitter, one near-certainty is that they will require money, time and attention. That raises another question: is the self-styled Technoking overextending himself?Financially, he isn\u2019t. The investment in Twitter, which cost less than $3bn, is chump change for Mr Musk\u2014about 1% of his net worth. A bigger concern, especially to investors in his other firms, is over his workload. Twitter comes on top of several big corporate commitments. Besides running Tesla, a $1.1trn electric-car giant with nearly 100,000 employees, he heads up , a privately held rocketry firm valued at $100bn. He also helped found two drilling startups, one making big holes to build tunnels (The Boring Company), the other making tiny ones to  (Neuralink). Adding a Twitter board seat to his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 may overtax even a functioning workaholic and astute delegator like Mr Musk. Now 50 years old and the father of eight, he has been putting in 100-hour weeks for decades, as he recently revealed in an interview.Where Mr Musk may be most over extended is in his trolling\u2014not so much of his numerous critics (though he does plenty of that in his spare time) but of regulators. America\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission was  for allegedly violating a court agreement to have his tweets lawyered before publishing, reached after he tweeted in 2018 that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take Tesla private, which he ended up not doing.The Twitter investment may get him into further trouble.

{"title": "Why an agricultural boom does not help rural America", "content": "FOR A PICTURE of the evolution of modern agriculture, you could do worse than visit the barn on Philip Volk\u2019s farm, near the city of Rugby in North Dakota. Inside the ageing building is hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of equipment. A huge red combine harvester sits next to the green \u201cair seeder\u201d, which looks a little like a bread slicer, and a tractor larger than a tank. Pulled by the tractor, which follows a -guided map automatically, the air seeder cuts through the soil and, in just a week or so, sows the entire crop, which on Mr Volk\u2019s farm is mostly spring wheat.

Inside the ageing building is hundreds of thousands of dollars-worth of equipment. A huge red combine harvester sits next to the green \u201cair seeder\u201d, which looks a little like a bread slicer, and a tractor larger than a tank. Pulled by the tractor, which follows a -guided map automatically, the air seeder cuts through the soil and, in just a week or so, sows the entire crop, which on Mr Volk\u2019s farm is mostly spring wheat. Five to six months later, the combine harvester picks it all up almost as quickly, and then trucks take it down the road to a grain elevator, where it is graded and loaded onto trains that carry it out to the west coast, mostly to be shipped to Japan.With a team of four (and a few more relatives and neighbours roped in at harvest time) Mr Volk is able to farm 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of land. His great-grand father, who immigrated to America from Germany, had to plough the land with horses, then sow it manually, with dozens, if not hundreds of workers. The farm\u2019s first tractor, purchased by Mr Volk\u2019s grandfather almost a century ago, still sits in the barn. It is dwarfed by the modern contraptions next to it, and would not be much use on the farm now. \u201cI would not want to go back and sit on an open-cab tractor and have the toil my grandfather had,\u201d says Mr Volk.America\u2019s farmers face interesting times. On the plains of North Dakota and Montana, as across the border in Saskatchewan in Canada, the biggest crop is spring wheat, which is planted in April and harvested in late summer. Planting on farms in Montana has begun already; Mr Volk will start soon. Thanks to the war in Ukraine, wheat prices are the highest they have been since 2008, meaning that farmers ought to make a lot of money. But they have to adjust for much higher input prices, too, particularly for fertiliser and fuel. And drought for much of the past three years has lowered output.Despite the higher prices, Mr Volk reckons that he will plant only 5-10% more wheat this year than he would have done without the war, because the risk of spending so much on inputs is too high if the crop does not actually come through. \u201cTwo weeks of the wrong weather can change the story in a heartbeat,\u201d he says.That is bad news for the consumers of wheat, in particular poor people in countries in north Africa which rely on now-lost Ukrainian and Russian supplies. Over half of American wheat is exported. But it ought to be good news for farmers, since a glut is unlikely to push prices down again soon.American farmers are making good money. Net farm income last year increased by 25%, according to the Department of Agriculture (), to its highest level since 2013. The department reckons that it may dip slightly this year, partly because of reduced government support linked to covid-19, and partly because of higher input costs. But only slightly. The price of farmland, an indicator of the profitability of farming, as well as interest rates, is the highest it has ever been. Farmland in Iowa, America\u2019s most agricultural state, has sold for over $20,000 an acre.In recent years politicians in Washington, , have funnelled money to farmers at an astonishing rate. In 2020 farmers received three times the normal level of subsidies, says Vincent Smith, an economist at Montana State University, thanks to payments related to covid and to Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars, which went outside the normal system of farm subsidies, passed in farm bills by Congress every five years. Total payments, most to 200,000 or so large farmers, amounted to $49bn (in 2022 dollars) or 0.2% of  (see left-hand chart). By comparison, spending on food stamps, which are also administered by the  and go to 40m people, was $87bn.Yet despite all this cash, rural America is in deep decline (see right-hand chart). According to the 2020 census, two-thirds of rural counties lost population from 2010 to 2020, and the total population of rural America fell for the first time in history. The counties that grew were mostly not farming ones but pretty places where people go to retire, near mountains or the ocean, or those with lots of oil. The midwestern areas which grow most of America\u2019s food are shrinking fastest. Pierce County, where Mr Volk\u2019s farm is, lost 8% of its people, even as North Dakotan counties farther west, where there has been a shale-oil boom for 15 years, grew prodigiously.The reason why is visible in Mr Volk\u2019s barn. As farming becomes more profitable, so do the gains from mechanisation. Today, just 6% of jobs in rural areas are directly linked to farming, points out Anne Schechinger, an agricultural economist for the Environmental Working Group, a research . Most farms, even small ones, \u201care highly capitalised agribusinesses growing one or two commodity crops and employing very few people\u201d, she says. Mr Volk says his farm is about as small as can be competitively run, to cover the costs of the hardware. Over the decades, it has gradually grown bigger as neighbours have retired and split their land up among heirs\u2014many of whom end up selling their bit to Mr Volk.Subsidies, largely in the form of crop insurance, help to ensure the food supply continues, and protect farmers from going bust during downturns. But they also determine what America farms\u2014incentivising farmers to grow vast amounts of soyabeans and corn, as well as wheat, which is mostly exported. Corn (maize) is boosted not only by direct subsidies but also by the Renewable Fuel Standard, which forces refiners to blend ethanol made from corn into petrol, in turn pushing up the value of the crop. Such crops are best grown on large, mechanised farms. Fresh fruit and vegetables, which Americans ought to eat more of, are more expensive to grow, and require more labour, but farmers receive almost no subsidies for them.Even if farmers are getting wealthier, the communities they live in are not. Mr Volk says that when he went to school, there were 40 children on his school bus. Today his youngest son goes on the bus with fewer than ten classmates. His eldest son is likely to take over the farm, but future children may have to go to a boarding school. It is harder to find people to serve as voluntary officials on the school board and county government. Many young people end up moving to places where the job opportunities are more exciting, if not necessarily more profitable. Over half of the churches that used to serve the community have closed. \u201cIt shrinks the community,\u201d Mr Volk says.Congress is beginning to consult on its next farm bill, which is due to pass next year. Even with prices as high as they are, most observers expect subsidies to stay steady or even grow. Farmers have been pushing for payments to encourage them to reduce CO emissions, says Mr Smith. \u201cAnd as far as I know, every major lobbying group endorsed that notion, preferably at very substantial levels.\u201d Helping out farmers is politically popular, not least because rural communities are over-represented in Congress. Yet the subsidies may in fact be sustaining the decline of rural America.

The central government plans to replace her with a tough ex-policeman, John Lee (pictured, left). What the public thinks matters little. three years ago, news of her imminent departure would have been greeted with joy on the streets of Hong Kong. Carrie Lam, the territory\u2019s leader (pictured, right), was reviled by the pro-democracy protesters whose demonstrations in 2019 snowballed into the biggest unrest of its kind in the territory\u2019s history. But Mrs Lam\u2019s announcement on April 4th that she would not seek another term in office\u2014meaning she has less than three months to serve\u2014stirred little cheer. The central government plans to replace her with a tough ex-policeman, John Lee (pictured, left). What the public thinks matters little.Interaction between the Communist Party in Beijing and Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, as the city\u2019s leader is known, is shrouded in secrecy. So it is hard to work out whether Mrs Lam had a choice. She said she had told the central authorities a year ago that she did not want another five-year term, \u201centirely\u201d for family reasons. But that could be a smokescreen. The party probably wants her to go. Newspapers in Hong Kong that are under the party\u2019s thumb have expressed no disappointment about her decision. They have intimated that Mr Lee, who was Hong Kong\u2019s security chief during the upheaval, is a shoo-in to succeed her.One reason for wanting a new leader may be Mrs Lam\u2019s handling of the territory\u2019s latest wave of covid-19, for which it was ill prepared. Thousands of people, most of them elderly, have died: vaccination rates within this group are low. Despite (and because of) Hong Kong\u2019s \u201czero-covid\u201d policy, which matches mainland China\u2019s, medical facilities have been overwhelmed by covid patients. The central authorities have been quick to punish local leaders on the mainland for much smaller outbreaks within their jurisdictions. Hong Kong notionally enjoys a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d, but the party may want to make a point that on this matter, no laxity is allowed.Officials in Beijing may also resent Mrs Lam\u2019s seeming failure to anticipate the unrest in 2019, which was triggered by her plan to introduce a bill that would allow criminals to be extradited for trial by the mainland\u2019s party-controlled courts. But the party\u2019s support for Mr Lee suggests it does not have big misgivings about her handling of the protests: he was her main adviser on how to police them.According to Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, the chief executive is selected locally and appointed by the central government. In practice the party controls the selection process, too. Mrs Lam timed her announcement with the start of a two-week period during which aspiring candidates for the post must secure sufficient nominations from the 1,500 members of an election committee, stacked with the party\u2019s loyalists. On May 8th the committee will choose the winner by vote. Most members will cast their ballots as the party wishes. Last year changes were made to the composition of the committee to make it even more compliant.Since the end of British rule in Hong Kong in 1997, the party has selected people either with broad experience in the territory\u2019s civil service (such as Mrs Lam) or who are prominent business leaders. All of them have struggled to keep both the leadership in Beijing and Hong Kong\u2019s public happy. None has yet served two five-year terms, the maximum allowed.The choice of Mr Lee is a striking departure from the norm. He has spent most of his career as a police officer. Even on the security-obsessed mainland, local leaders are rarely people with such a specialist background. Only in the past decade has the 64-year-old served in a more political role, first as under-secretary and then as secretary for security (a cabinet post, in effect). His only experience outside the security realm has been in the past year, as Mrs Lam\u2019s deputy. On April 6th he resigned from that post and declared his bid for the chief-executive position.It is easy to see why the party would like him. He has enthusiastically embraced the draconian national-security law that the central government imposed on the territory in 2020 to prevent a resurgence of the previous year\u2019s unrest (tougher police tactics and pandemic social-distancing measures having helped to stifle it). The police have used the new bill, and colonial-era laws, to arrest thousands of people for protest-related offences.Crushing dissent in Hong Kong remains the party\u2019s priority. On the day that Mr Lee announced his campaign, a businessman in Hong Kong with close ties to China\u2019s leadership, Lo Man Tuen, published an article in the local press. It said the territory needed an \u201ciron man\u201d leader who could resist \u201cAmerican and British pressure\u201d and implement the security law with \u201cno second thoughts\u201d. The party seems to think Mr Lee fits the bill.

It looked as if enough defectors had joined the opposition to bring down his government in a no-confidence vote in Pakistan\u2019s National Assembly on April 3rd. But the prime minister, who captained Pakistan\u2019s triumph in the 1992 World Cup cricket final, bowled a googly. He declared the bid to unseat him a foreign conspiracy, dodged the floor vote, dissolved parliament and called for fresh elections.Opposition legislators cried foul. They said Mr Khan had violated the constitution by getting the deputy speaker of the assembly, a close ally, to quash the vote on vague grounds of a national security threat. The Supreme Court was called in to umpire the mess. The judges have refused to be rushed. On April 6th they held a third day of hearings, and were due to resume on April 7th. Pakistan is meanwhile in constitutional deadlock.If the judges rule against Mr Khan, the no-confidence vote will be held and he will almost certainly be out of power, less than four years into his five-year term. A new government, probably a broad coalition led by Shehbaz Sharif, the brother of Mr Khan\u2019s predecessor Nawaz Sharif, would then be in charge.The court could rule instead for fresh elections under a caretaker government. By law such a vote should take place within 90 days, but officials say it might take longer to prepare. This could give Mr Khan what he wants, which is time to mount a counter-offensive against opponents he berates as corrupt. The court could also simply dither. The longer the legal stand-off ensues, the less inclined the judges would be to reconstitute the assembly and reimpose the vote, the opposition fears.The crisis has flared quickly and reflects a rapid downturn in Mr Khan\u2019s fortunes. The 69-year-old won power in 2018 on an anti-corruption platform, promising to dislodge the country\u2019s venal political elite. He also vowed to create an Islamic welfare state.But though he had some success averting damage from the pandemic, extending a social safety net and offering health insurance, Pakistan\u2019s worsening economy is hurting ordinary people. Inflation is almost 13% (see chart). The Pakistani rupee trades at more than 180 to the dollar, 50% more than when Mr Khan took charge. The World Bank says  per person has fallen from nearly $1,500 in 2018 to $1,200 in 2020. Mr Khan\u2019s confrontational style and insistence on jailing \u201ccorrupt\u201d political opponents also left little room to manoeuvre while defending a slim majority.But many believe the biggest factor in his fall has been a breakdown in relations with the chief of the army staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, though Mr Khan denies a rift. The army for its part has always insisted, implausibly, that it is politically neutral. For years, Mr Khan\u2019s opponents have charged that he owes his ascent solely to the powerful, unaccountable military establishment that has ruled Pakistan directly for much of its history and pulled strings for much of the rest.General Bajwa and Mr Khan appeared to clash in October over who should be head of the armed forces\u2019 formidable Inter-Services Intelligence (), a sprawling agency with covert fingers in many pies, including Afghanistan. The suspicion that Mr Khan wished to disrupt the military line of succession in order to have his own man in the top job proved too much for General Bajwa, some analysts believe.Mr Khan\u2019s railing against America and its allies may also have alarmed the army. The prime minister appeared in Moscow, shaking hands with Vladimir Putin, on the very day that Russia invaded Ukraine. That was perhaps seen as an embarrassment\u2014though not by Mr Khan, who has roused supporters by declaring that America is conspiring with the opposition to oust him for daring to pursue his own foreign policy, and for seeking good relations with Russia and China. Yet Mr Khan has given no evidence of any plot and America dismisses the charge as baseless.Cosy relations with the army are unlikely to resume, whatever the Supreme Court rules. This could spell trouble for Mr Khan, regardless of whether his fate is handed back to parliament, or to the polls. Yet the prime minister\u2019s populist gambit\u2014casting his looming parliamentary defeat as international persecution abetted by a traitorous opposition\u2014may prove tactically deft. Polling by Gallup suggests that 36% of Pakistanis buy the conspiracy line. Among shopkeepers in a commercial district of Rawalpindi that voted for his party in 2018, many accept his claim that the West is out to get him. \u201cAmerica will never want Imran Khan in power, because he is not a yes-man,\u201d says Mohammed Zahid, who sells embroidered women\u2019s tunics. \u201cExternal powers don\u2019t like that our country now has true leadership.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/09/imran-khan-is-trying-every-trick-in-the-book-to-stay-in-power", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T14:35:33Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_asp501.jpg"},

Better yet, Europe may have found new ways to combat this long-running affliction. Potent though it is at home, Mr Orban\u2019s brand of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d may finally be fading in virulence.True, Mr Orban\u2019s victory is one of a long series of unwelcome triumphs by practitioners of despot-lite politics. His resounding win will cheer strongmen who like to add a veneer of democratic legitimacy to their autocratic regimes, from Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey to Vladimir Putin in Russia. But Mr Orban\u2019s influence beyond Hungary\u2014not least in America\u2019s Trumpian swamp\u2014comes from his contrived defiance towards liberal \u201celites\u201d in Brussels and elsewhere. Sitting at Europe\u2019s top table while flouting its rules is a core part of the Orban shtick. The more his European peers rant ineffectually about Hungary misspending  funds, hobbling the media, bashing gay people and subverting courts, the more Mr Orban looks like he matters.No one, in the  or elsewhere, can turn Mr Orban back into the liberal politician he once seemed to be. Yet Europe has a rare opportunity to isolate and neutralise him. If it works, Mr Orban, the \u2019s longest-serving leader currently in office, will become a politician whose relevance barely extends beyond Hungary\u2019s borders.Three things have changed since the last time Fidesz triumphed at the polls, in 2018. The first is Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. This may have helped Mr Orban win: state-backed media unquestioningly relayed his baseless claim that the opposition would drag Hungary into war with Russia. But positioning himself as the closest thing to an ally Mr Putin has in the \u2014by opposing sending weapons to Ukraine, and balking at many proposed sanctions\u2014has stripped Mr Orban of allies. Fidesz\u2019s election victories used to be cheered by some of Hungary\u2019s neighbours, such as Poland and Slovakia. This win, by contrast, was greeted the way office workers greet the news that a deskmate has covid. The only noteworthy message of congratulations came from Mr Putin.Until now, Europe has been forced to tolerate Mr Orban\u2019s behaviour because he had allies. Countries in the Visegrad Group, comprising Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, long elected leaders who shared Mr Orban\u2019s illiberal leanings. This club-within-a-club stymied even the largely symbolic wrist-slapping the  can mete out to those who break its rules: anyone bar the country being targeted could veto a move to strip it of voting rights in  meetings, for example. But the Czech Republic and Slovakia have in recent years elected more centrist politicians. Poland, run by the Law and Justice party, still leans illiberal and had stuck with Hungary the longest. Now it is sharply criticising Mr Orban for his pro-Russian stance. Hungary is in a club of one.Second, Europe has new powers to bring wayward members to heel. An unspoken deal paved the way for a slew of central European states to join the  in 2004. Richer countries already in the club would agree to funnel lots of cash to Hungary and others to improve their infrastructure and so forth. In exchange, the \u201cnew\u201d Europeans would guarantee open economies, free courts, unrestrained media and other liberal requirements. On returning to power in 2010 (after a first stint from 1998-2002), Mr Orban realised that he could take the money without honouring his side of the bargain. European taxpayers ended up funding projects that made his cronies fabulously rich. Yet even brazen defiance of  principles did not stop the flow of cash.Now it might. A \u20ac750bn ($818bn) fund to ease the economic effects of covid, known as Next Generation , required member states to satisfy Eurocrats that the money would be well spent. Poland and Hungary are the only two countries to have been rebuffed, both over infringements of the rule of law. Poland seems likely to get its share soon: its ruling party has made gestures to comply with  demands that it stop nobbling the court system, and other members want to reward it for taking in most of the refugees from Ukraine. Hungary has begged for the \u20ac7bn earmarked for it, to no avail. On April 5th Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said a new mechanism to withhold even regular  funds from countries not abiding by European norms would be used for the first time against Hungary. It stands to lose up to \u20ac24bn over the next five years; Poland will be spared. Mr Orban can remain defiant, but he may run out of money.Perhaps most importantly, war on the continent has worn down whatever patience Europe once had towards those who seek to undermine it. Mr Putin\u2019s behaviour has shown that indulging autocrats, in the hope that trade with liberal countries will lead them to change their ways, doesn\u2019t work. Angela Merkel, a fan of that approach in her time as German chancellor, repeatedly blocked attacks on Mr Orban. Until a year ago she made sure Fidesz was allowed to remain in the European People\u2019s Party, the alliance of centre-right parties in the European Parliament. Now she is gone.None of this is likely to be enough to change Mr Orban\u2019s ways. For the next four years at least he will continue to dominate his unfortunate country, and his cronies will continue to loot it. But an isolated Hungary stripped of  funding will stand as a cautionary tale to other would-be strongmen in the bloc: there are limits to what they can get away with. There is no cure yet for Orbanism. But in Europe, at least, it looks like it can be contained.

{"title": "Asia\u2019s outbreaks show that Omicron is deadly in unvaccinated people", "content": "DURING THE  first two years of the covid-19 pandemic, rich Asian countries had lower case rates than almost anywhere else. But like a dam holding back a flood, the longer a region\u2019s defences hold up, the worse the resulting disaster once they fail.  first two years of the covid-19 pandemic, rich Asian countries had lower case rates than almost anywhere else. But like a dam holding back a flood, the longer a region\u2019s defences hold up, the worse the resulting disaster once they fail.The Omicron variant has swept remarkably fast through places with little past exposure to covid. As a share of population, South Korea has logged more cases in 2022 than America has during the entire pandemic. Hong Kong\u2019s surge has been even more abrupt. Until this February, it barely had any positive tests. Its cumulative caseload per person now matches Finland\u2019s.In Europe Omicron has caused greater increases in cases than in hospitalisations or deaths. Two factors have combined to yield such mild disease: strong immunity levels and Omicron\u2019s low severity when compared with Delta. Until recently, it was unclear which mattered more. But the Asian data show that immunity is crucial, and that Omicron is still deadly for unvaccinated people who have not yet had covid.Hong Kong and South Korea provide a natural experiment. Both were mostly covid-free before 2022, and had little infection-induced immunity. But South Korea has had a strong vaccine roll-out, whereas Hong Kong has had one of the rich world\u2019s worst. Its messaging was decidedly mixed, giving equal weight to arguments for and against vaccination, and telling people with chronic diseases to consult doctors before getting jabs. Its nurses worried about personal liability for mishaps.Hong Kong also made heavy use of Sinovac, a Chinese vaccine that is less effective than Western shots. According to , a newspaper, of Hong Kongers who died in the recent wave, 71% were unvaccinated and another 25% had received Sinovac. Just 4% got Western vaccines.Unfortunately, Hong Kong\u2019s elderly were unusually hesitant. In South Korea take-up of booster shots, which are needed to protect against Omicron, is greatest among the old. In Hong Kong, in contrast, those most likely to get boosted are middle-aged. Just 37% of its septuagenarians and 14% of those 80 or older, the most vulnerable groups, are boosted\u2014similar to the shares among people aged 20-39 and teenagers, respectively. When Omicron first struck, these rates were even lower.This discrepancy has had a big impact. During the Omicron wave, Hong Kong\u2019s official covid mortality rate has been five times higher than South Korea\u2019s. These figures can be biased by differences in testing rates and judgments on causes of death. But fair comparisons can be made with excess mortality\u2014the gap between the number of deaths from all causes and the number expected under normal conditions.Although recent total-mortality numbers have not been published, our best estimate suggests that since February 1st 2.4 times as many people have died because of the pandemic in Hong Kong as in South Korea. At the peak of Hong Kong\u2019s surge in early March, its daily excess-death rate was between those registered in London (1.8 per 100,000 people) and New York (5.1) when covid first struck\u2014a period with no vaccines, little testing and an incorrect understanding of how the virus spreads.

{"title": "When Albert Einstein and Henri Bergson rowed about time", "content": "ACENTURY AGO , on April 6th 1922, the world\u2019s most famous philosopher debated against the most famous  and lost. Henri Bergson, a French thinker who caused Broadway\u2019s first traffic jam when he gave a lecture in New York, had challenged the  advanced by Albert Einstein, the discoverer of relativity.

Henri Bergson, a French thinker who caused Broadway\u2019s first traffic jam when he gave a lecture in New York, had challenged the  advanced by Albert Einstein, the discoverer of relativity. Bergson was putting his thoughts into book form when Einstein came to Paris.At a gathering hosted by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise de philosophie, which followed a talk by , they finally locked horns. Bergson summarised part of his forthcoming book, \u201cDuration and Simultaneity\u201d. Einstein\u2019s rebuttal was withering. There is \u201cno such thing as a philosopher\u2019s time\u201d, he asserted. Bergson\u2019s version of it was merely \u201cpsychological time\u201d. Their stilted \u201cnon-conversation\u201d was a \u201cmajor anticlimax\u201d, says Elie During, a (living) French philosopher. Bergson\u2019s reputation waned; magazine named Einstein its \u201cperson of the century\u201d.Lopsided though the contest was, philosophers and scientists still ponder it. At stake is not just the momentous question of what time is. The debate was a key event in the separation of sciences and humanities into what C.P. Snow, a British novelist, later called \u201ctwo cultures\u201d. Einstein saw science as \u201cthe ultimate arbiter of truth\u201d, says Jimena Canales, author of \u201cThe Physicist and the Philosopher\u201d, a book about the episode. Bergson insisted that science did not have the last word. Their clash, Ms Canales says, raised the question, \u201cWhat is the relation between the subjective and the objective, and can we have a form of knowledge that includes both?\u201dThe philosopher was in the time business long before the physicist. Bergson published his first book, \u201cTime and Free Will\u201d, in 1889, when Einstein was ten years old. Initially an adherent of the idea that the world works like a machine, in the course of investigating evolution he encountered what he came to regard as science\u2019s mistaken notion of time.This views time in terms of space: an hour measures one-twenty-fourth of the Earth\u2019s rotation. While useful, clock time misses what is most important about time, Bergson decided, namely \u201cduration\u201d. Rather than being disconnected from the past, the way one point on a ruler is separated from another, the present is suffused with it. Music is an example: each instant consists not only of itself but of what came before it. \u201cPure duration is the form that the succession of our states of consciousness adopts when the self lets itself live, when it stops establishing a separation between its present and former states,\u201d Bergson wrote.The passage of time\u2014the present billowed with the past\u2014provides escape from a clockwork universe. This approach does not deny the importance of matter, but places life partially outside it. It is duration that permits novelty, both in the life forms that emerge from evolution and in the acts that proceed from the exercise of free will. Bergson applied his most famous epithet to life\u2019s struggle with the material world, with which it is also bound up: . People\u2019s very identities are the \u201ctemporal synthesis that is duration\u201d, as Mark Sinclair puts it in a recent book on Bergson.His ideas were hugely influential. The literature of his day teems with Bergsonian characters, living between durational and clockwork worlds. T.S. Eliot (who heard him speak) seems to lament the splaying of time in space in \u201cThe Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\u201d, writing of the evening \u201cspread out against the sky/Like a patient etherised upon a table\u201d. For the narrator of \u201cIn Search of Lost Time\u201d, the memories awakened by a madeleine\u2019s taste are enough to abolish clock time. Bergson married a cousin of Marcel Proust, the novel\u2019s author, who was best man at his wedding. A spellbinding writer himself, Bergson won the Nobel prize in literature in 1927.Even before his showdown with Einstein, though, Bergson was mocked for purveying metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. His exaltation of intuition, the faculty through which duration is apprehended, over intellect provided a fat target for Bertrand Russell, a British logician. According to Russell, writing in 1912, Bergson thought that the universe was \u201ca vast funicular railway, in which life is the train that goes up, and matter the train that goes down.\u201d Like advertising men Bergson relied upon \u201cpicturesque and varied statement\u201d. In his \u201cHistory of Western Philosophy\u201d (1945), Russell added that the irrationalism of Bergson\u2019s philosophy \u201charmonised easily with the movement which culminated in Vichy\u201d\u2014a brutal comment about a Jew who refused special treatment from the Nazi-backed regime.Einstein and Bergson were a study in contrasts. The German-born physicist was a pacifist and, until just before his death, a meat-eater; Bergson found philosophical grounds for France\u2019s role in the first world war\u2014and was a vegetarian. Their clash in Paris was principally over Einstein\u2019s special theory of relativity, which had supplanted the unvarying time of Isaac Newton\u2019s physics.Relativity states that time flows at different rates\u2014faster or slower\u2014for observers moving with respect to each other, as most do. Space compresses too, with the result that simultaneity is not absolute. This means that, in general, distinct observers witness events separated in space in different orders. Time and space blur together in a way implying that the past and future may be as real as the present, just as the Moon is as real as the Earth, a view sometimes called \u201ceternalism\u201d. The \u201cdistinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion\u201d, Einstein famously wrote.This was a frontal challenge to Bergson\u2019s central idea. \u201cIf time\u201d, he wrote, \u201cis thus spread out in space\u2026it takes account neither of what is essential to succession nor of duration in so far as it flows.\u201d Bergson did not deny Einstein\u2019s discoveries; philosophy must be \u201cconstantly verified by contact with the positive sciences\u201d, he averred. But he maintained that relativity\u2019s profusion of times are not all equally real. It could not overthrow the \u201ccommon-sense\u201d belief in \u201ca single time, the same for all beings and all things\u201d. In fact, properly understood, relativity confirms that.In defending this position, Bergson denied the consequence of the special theory illustrated by the \u201ctwin paradox\u201d: if Peter remains on Earth while Paul rides a rocket into space and then returns, Peter will have aged more than Paul. Special relativity says that the faster something moves relative to you, the slower its clock will tick, from your point of view. Bergson insisted that the reunited twins will have aged by the same amount. This proved to be his \u201cAchilles heel\u201d, writes Ms Canales.Most physicists continue to disdain Bergson, not mainly because of his twin gaffe but because of his attempted prison-break from the material world. Carlo Rovelli, an Italian theoretical physicist, makes one dismissive reference to the philosopher in his recent book \u201cThe Order of Time\u201d. Bergson \u201ccorrectly pointed out that experiential time has more features than the time the physicists were talking about\u201d, Mr Rovelli says. But he \u201cincorrectly deduced from that there must be something that escapes physics in the real world.\u201d Now, when science is under attack from anti-vaxxers and others, Bergson\u2019s spiritualism seems to some not just wrong-headed but dangerous. Ms Canales says a physicist warned her \u201cthat my career would be finished\u201d if she published a book that took Bergson seriously.Yet he still matters, in two ways. He continues to influence thinkers who deem a materialistic account of the world to be inadequate, such as Rupert Sheldrake, author of \u201cThe Science Delusion\u201d. And some who do not agree that science is deluded still find inspiration in Bergson\u2019s ideas, and seek to reconcile them with Einstein\u2019s.Louis de Broglie, a pioneer of quantum physics, recognised Bergson as a seer. Had he studied quantum theory \u201che would doubtless have observed with joy that in the image of the evolution of the physical world which it offers us, at each instant nature is described as if hesitating between a multiplicity of possibilities\u201d, de Broglie wrote. Jenann Ismael, a philosopher of science, argues that any being, man or machine, that gathers and uses information would perceive time as passing and the future as open. That time is no less real than Einstein\u2019s static four-dimensional \u201cspacetime\u201d, she says. There is a \u201csense of conflict being replaced by a bridge\u201d.The debate in Paris found both thinkers at their most dogmatic. Afterwards Bergson seems to have had second thoughts about some aspects of \u201cDuration and Simultaneity\u201d\u2014though he never abandoned his basic position. In subsequent decades Einstein seemed to budge more. He acknowledged that metaphysics plays a role in science, and became more troubled by the failure of physics to give a complete description of time.The \u201cproblem of Now worried him seriously\u201d, wrote the philosopher Rudolf Carnap. It means \u201csomething essentially different from the past and the future\u201d, yet \u201cthis important difference does not and cannot occur within physics\u201d. Perhaps the ageing physicist came close to admitting that a philosopher\u2019s time exists after all.

{"title": "Bain Capital buying Toshiba could be a big deal for Japan", "content": "TOSHIBA WAS once synonymous with Japan\u2019s industrial might.

Of late the conglomerate, which has made everything from memory cards to nuclear reactors, has become a byword for drama. Japan\u2019s business press writes of \u201cToshiba Theatre\u201d, which began with accounting fraud a decade ago and has continued to the present day in a series of \u201cslapstick\u201d struggles between management and shareholders. Toshiba\u2019s share price has underperformed domestic and foreign rivals, as well as the broader Japanese stockmarket (see chart).The latest plot twist comes amid talk of a buy-out led by Bain Capital, an American private-equity group. This raised hopes among investors for some sort of resolution to the saga. Toshiba\u2019s market value has risen by a quarter in the past month.The opening act in the Toshiba spectacle was tragic. The firm cooked its books to inflate profits by $1.2bn between 2007 and 2014. Implicated executives bowed deeply in apology. A new crop of leaders had to apologise again two years later when a big bet on Westinghouse, an American nuclear-power company, went sour. To remain solvent, Toshiba sold its prized memory-chip unit to a Bain-led consortium and issued a block of new shares. Foreign activist investors spied opportunity. Effissimo Capital Management (), a Singaporean asset manager, amassed a stake of nearly 10%, making it the single largest shareholder in the company.That set the stage for a protracted second act of tragicomedy. As shareholders pushed for better returns and more transparency, Toshiba executives squirmed. Some colluded with the Japanese government to stop the activists from getting seats on the board in 2020, according to an independent inquiry. A year ago a surprise bid to take the company private collapsed, bringing the  Kurumatani Nobuaki, down with it. Tsunakawa Satoshi, a former boss who returned to the job after Mr Kurumatani\u2019s ousting, argued instead that the group should be split up.This plan, too, faltered, and on March 1st Mr Tsunakawa fell on his sword. At an extraordinary general meeting three weeks later, shareholders killed the management\u2019s proposal for a split into two businesses, one focused on electronics, the other on infrastructure. At the same time, they also rebuffed calls from Toshiba\u2019s second-largest investor for the group to court buy-out offers.The impasse set the stage for act three. On March 31st  announced it had signed an agreement to sell its stake to Bain if regulators gave the nod to the American firm\u2019s bid. A deal would be hefty. Toshiba\u2019s market value is $17.5bn; a premium could add a few billion, putting it in striking distance of the top ten leveraged buy-outs in history. Given Toshiba\u2019s history (which stretches back to 1875) and prominence (it employs nearly 120,000 people), the transaction would also mark a big advance for both foreign investors and private equity in Japan, which has not historically been welcoming to either.Hurdles remain. Japanese laws regulating foreign investment were amended in 2020 to increase oversight of industries important to national security. Toshiba has interests in several, including nuclear power, defence, chips and quantum computing. Regulators helped scuttle earlier buy-out bids. Bain appears to have learned from those experiences, and is said to be in discussions with Japanese funds and companies to form a consortium that would be palatable to the government. But \u201cmany issues\u201d must still be resolved, Bain acknowledged. The curtain is far from closed.

At least as many covid patients will be spirited out\u2014bused to field hospitals in neighbouring areas, sometimes hundreds of kilometres away. The rest of the city\u2019s 25m residents will remain locked down as the fight against the virus drags on.For two years China\u2019s business and finance hub remained relatively unscathed by covid. Shanghai was evidence of the government\u2019s skilful handling of the pandemic. The country\u2019s \u201czero-covid\u201d approach, involving mass testing and strict lockdowns to crush outbreaks, led to fewer deaths and stronger economic growth than in other big countries. Xi Jinping, the president, has hailed the strategy as a great success\u2014and proof that China\u2019s socialist system is superior to Western democracy.But the situation in Shanghai is testing all that. Not since the start of the pandemic, when the government sealed off Wuhan, a city of 11m people, have the country\u2019s covid measures come under such scrutiny. The campaign in Shanghai has been nothing short of a mess, say residents. They have faced varying restrictions since early March and are now confined to their homes. Food shortages are a problem. People complain of going without medicine. In China\u2019s largest city the government\u2019s strict covid controls are stoking anger.For weeks the authorities in Shanghai experimented with a looser approach. They used targeted lockdowns on housing compounds to contain the virus. But the highly transmissible Omicron variant continued to spread. The government tried to quash any talk of harsher measures in the offing, even detaining people for spreading rumours. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to use the lockdown strategy for now,\u201d said Zhang Wenhong, who runs Shanghai\u2019s covid response, on March 25th. Three days later a two-phase lockdown was announced. First the east side of the city was closed for four days, then the west side. Even that proved ineffective. So, as the staggered lockdown came to an end, the government closed the entire city indefinitely.Unsurprisingly, the authorities were unready to support people during the hastily conceived lockdowns. And residents themselves were given little time to prepare. Some rushed to supermarkets, leaving aisles empty. Getting basic provisions has become a struggle. Messaging boards linked to Weibo, a popular Twitter-like platform, have been inundated with pleas for help. One woman said her father, who is suffering from cancer, was blocked from leaving his home and is \u201cconsidering suicide\u201d. A man sought epilepsy medication for his young son; he \u201cdid not dare consider the consequences\u201d of failing to obtain it. Videos show people fighting over boxes of food. This correspondent has struggled to obtain potable water.Abandoned warehouses, expo centres and shipping containers have been converted into makeshift isolation centres for those who test positive. Videos show patients protesting against a lack of food, water and treatment. Health workers have been filmed striking people or pulling them by their hair from their homes. But the authorities\u2019 most controversial policy has been separating covid-positive children from their parents. Videos of dozens of children, some just months old, lying five to a bed, caused an uproar. The government has since said that infected parents could accompany their covid-positive offspring, and that healthy parents of infected children with special requirements could apply to go with them.People have also been angered by the leaked recording of a phone call purportedly between a Shanghai resident and an official from the local office of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. On the call, which  has not verified, the official says Shanghai\u2019s policies have been driven by political considerations, not public-health concerns. She says that co-ordination between hospitals has been poor and that medical supplies are running low. People with mild or no symptoms should quarantine at home, she suggests, contradicting official policy. She also says tests have been rigged to show negative results in order to free up capacity in the overwhelmed health system while appearing to adhere to the government\u2019s zero-covid mandate.News of the call was quickly followed by a visit to Shanghai by Sun Chunlan, a deputy prime minister in charge of fighting covid, who reiterated the state\u2019s \u201cunswerving adherence to the dynamic zero-covid approach\u201d. Until recently that strategy has seemed broadly popular, as it has allowed most of China\u2019s 1.4bn people to lead relatively normal lives. But the fast spread of Omicron means the number of people caught up in the state\u2019s covid controls is growing, including all of Shanghai\u2019s residents. The grumbling is getting louder on social media, despite the state\u2019s best efforts to censor it. Complaints from Shanghai resonate loudly among China\u2019s leaders: the city is of immense political importance, being home to many of the country\u2019s rich and powerful.There is no easy remedy for its sufferings. Mr Xi is expected to gain a third term as party chief later this year, in violation of recent norms. He does not want that moment of triumph to be overshadowed by pandemic-related chaos. A relaxation of controls might cause an even bigger surge of infections that could imperil far more of the country\u2019s rickety health infrastructure. But maintaining them would be risky, too. Analysts believe the measures are dealing a big blow to , which may not grow at all this quarter compared with the last.What effect this will have on China\u2019s politics is a subject of much speculation. One name to watch is that of Li Qiang, Shanghai\u2019s party secretary and a close ally of the president. Experts expect Mr Li to be picked for the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, the country\u2019s most powerful political body, later this year. Some think he will become the next prime minister. But the mess in Shanghai may dim Mr Li\u2019s prospects. In Hong Kong, central-government frustration with the city\u2019s handling of a recent covid wave could be one reason why Carrie Lam has announced she will not stand again as the .For now, cases in Shanghai continue to rise. Food is growing scarcer. Residents have been filmed on their balconies, chanting to be set free. But most old people have not been vaccinated and relatively few Chinese have natural immunity. A large outbreak in the country could result in millions of deaths. The effort in Shanghai may look like a military campaign, but it is to avoid a broader war.

As covid-induced panic gripped markets in March 2020, it dropped by 12% against the dollar in the space of a fortnight (the euro fell by just 6%). When British petrol pumps ran dry last September, it plunged again and traders\u2019 expectations of its future volatility soared. The Bank of England\u2019s decision to raise interest rates earlier than most has since held it steadier, but some commentators remain adamant that the pound has not just decoupled from the currencies of other developed economies, but also joined the ranks of  ones.Such claims are usually made with the speaker\u2019s tongue planted firmly in their cheek.  currencies\u2019 delightful attributes include capital controls (the Chinese yuan), hyperinflation (the Argentine peso) and \u201cunorthodox\u201d monetary policies (the Turkish lira). Liquidity crunches during market routs can subject sterling to harsh devaluations, explaining why it is not a haven like the dollar or the Swiss franc. But in normal times, call up a bank\u2019s foreign-exchange () trading desk asking to sell half a billion pounds and they won\u2019t struggle to do so. That they might for an  currency is the category\u2019s distinguishing feature.In fact, sterling is notable for the opposite: it plays an oddly outsize role in  markets. Britain accounts for 3% of the world\u2019s . Yet over the past 20 years its currency has consistently been involved in over a tenth of  trades.So why do traders like sterling, if it is so brittle? You might trade a foreign currency if you want to buy goods or services from the country that issues it. Or you might sell something in exchange for it and want to convert the proceeds back to your currency. Neither explains sterling\u2019s popularity: in 2019 Britain accounted for 3.8% of global goods imports and 2.6% of exports. Nor is it prominent in central-bank holdings (it makes up less than 5% of global reserves). The dollar dominates global payments, many governments borrow in it and some markets\u2014commodities\u2014are priced in it. The pound does none of these jobs.In fact it is a means to less grand aims: speculation and cross-border investment. People trade sterling to take a punt on its value, or because they are buying or selling British assets. In this it has more in common with another rich-world currency. Like sterling, the Australian dollar is issued by an open, developed economy that relies heavily on trade. Punters use both to bet on trends that are bigger than their issuers\u2019 economic footprint: sterling is a proxy for risk appetite; the Aussie dollar for commodity prices. And they loom larger in  markets than either their economies\u2019 heft or trade volumes warrant. Australia makes up less than 2% of world , yet its dollar is present in 6.8% of  trades.Five years after the Brexit vote, there is little sign of the Global Britain that voters were promised, and declaring sterling an  currency suits the country\u2019s fondness for declinism. But to understand the role of the pound today, look Down Under.

When at the Fed\u2019s helm, Janet Yellen compared it to watching paint dry. Jerome Powell, her successor, says it will operate in the background. In truth it is akin to dismantling an auxiliary engine for the economy, with only hazy knowledge of the consequences.As Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s board, noted on April 5th, this round of  will be more aggressive than the Fed\u2019s previous iteration. With inflation racing ahead and the labour market tight, the central bank wants to cool the economy quickly. Coupled with interest-rate rises,  is likely to be a drag on growth.So far the Fed has reinvested the proceeds of maturing bonds in order to maintain its stock of assets. The minutes suggest it is likely to shrink its balance-sheet not by making active sales, but by letting some maturing bonds \u201croll off\u201d, without reinvestment. The roll-off may start in May. Come July, all going well, the Fed will raise the maximum roll-off to $95bn per month, split between $60bn of Treasuries and $35bn of mortgage-backed bonds. At full tilt, the Fed could shrink its balance-sheet by more than $1trn over a 12-month period, twice as fast as its first go at . \u201cEven if it\u2019s done in a predictable way, this is a big adjustment for markets,\u201d says Brian Sack of D.E. Shaw, an investment firm.Multiple rounds of bond-buying by central banks since the financial crisis of 2007-09 have yielded some understanding of how  works. It signals a commitment to ultra-low interest rates. It suppresses long-term rates. And it supports liquidity, ensuring that markets operate smoothly. looks like  in reverse. Instead of creating central-bank reserves (held by the private sector) by purchasing bonds, the central bank drains reserves by refraining from reinvesting as bonds mature. The three channels through which  works also operate in reverse. First,  sends a signal that rate rises are coming. Notably, it was in early January, when the Fed discussed a faster approach to  than many had expected, that market rates shot up.The second channel\u2014 \u2019s direct impact on yields\u2014involves heroic guesstimates. Some analysts think the Fed will shrink its balance-sheet by $3trn over the next three years (taking it to about 20% of , down from 36% now). Mark Cabana of Bank of America reckons this could equate to anywhere between a quarter point and 1.25 percentage points of rate increases\u2014a remarkably wide range. Mr Powell has also noted the uncertainty about : \u201cWe have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions.\u201dWhen the Fed raises interest rates, it is raising overnight borrowing rates, which then ripple along the yield curve. With , the main impact is on longer-term yields. For some economists, such as Kristin Forbes of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, this means that  could be more potent than rate rises, since it would target hot segments of the credit market, such as . The Fed has said that it will stick with rate increases\u2014the devil it knows\u2014as its main tool. If, however,  does hit longer yields, it may need fewer rate rises to tame inflation.The final channel is liquidity. As the Fed buys fewer bonds, there may be fewer transactions overall. Indeed, a Bloomberg index that measures the ease of trading Treasuries recently worsened to levels last seen at the pandemic\u2019s start. That echoes uncomfortably with the past round of , which culminated in a liquidity crunch in the overnight-borrowing market. But the Fed is better prepared this time. There is much more cash in the market to begin with. And the Fed has set up an overnight-lending facility, which should let banks get funds if needed. \u201cThe risk of a spike in rates like we had in September 2019 is much, much lower,\u201d says Bill Dudley, former president of the New York Fed.Yet new concerns will emerge. The Fed\u2019s mortgage bonds have long tenors, so passive roll-offs would take decades. The central bank may have to make active sales, which it wants to avoid. Another concern is the Fed\u2019s $326bn in short-term Treasury bills. Some observers think it will roll them off, supercharging ; others fear that would stoke volatility.

{"title": "A toxic mix of recession risks hangs over the world economy", "content": "JUST A YEAR ago the world\u2019s economists were celebrating a rapid rebound from recession. Now they are worrying that the next downturn could be looming. In America the Federal Reserve is preparing to do battle with high inflation by  sharply and shrinking its balance-sheet. In Europe expensive energy is sapping consumers of spending power and making factories costlier to run. And in China an outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has led the authorities to impose the strictest lockdowns since the start of the pandemic. ago the world\u2019s economists were celebrating a rapid rebound from recession. Now they are worrying that the next downturn could be looming. In America the Federal Reserve is preparing to do battle with high inflation by  sharply and shrinking its balance-sheet. In Europe expensive energy is sapping consumers of spending power and making factories costlier to run. And in China an outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has led the authorities to impose the strictest lockdowns since the start of the pandemic.It is a gloomy combination for global growth, and the outlook is darkening. Several economies could even suffer recessions, though at different times depending on the obstacles they face.The economy in the United States is overheating. The annual rate of consumer-price inflation is 7.9% and hourly wages are 5.6% higher than they were a year ago. America has nearly twice as many job openings as it does unemployed workers\u2014the highest ratio in 70 years. For much of 2021 central bankers hoped that Americans who left the labour force after the pandemic struck would return, helping cool the labour market. In the past six months their prayers have been answered: more than half the missing workers of prime working age . Yet wage growth has risen anyway, perhaps because workers are negotiating hard as rising prices erode living standards.The Fed needs both wage and price growth to cool if it is to hit its 2% inflation target. It is expected to raise short-term interest rates, which started the year below 0.25%, to over 2.5% by December, and to continue to raise rates above 3% in 2023. This week the central bank trailed a plan to shrink its $8.5trn bond holdings, starting in May, at a much faster pace than during the last period of \u201c\u201d.Hitting the monetary brakes, though necessary, endangers growth. History suggests that the Fed finds it difficult to cool the jobs market without eventually tipping the economy into recession. It has pulled off a \u201csoft landing\u201d only three times since 1945. And it has never done so while battling high inflation. Bond investors are betting that in two years\u2019 time the Fed will have to cut rates again as the economy weakens. Given the record, a recession in the next two years looks likely.Europe has an inflation problem, too, but it is so far caused by expensive imported energy and food more than by overheating. Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions threaten the continent\u2019s energy supply. Gas prices for next winter are five times higher than in America, and spending on household energy is almost twice as high as a share of  (partly because Europe is poorer). As energy prices have surged, consumer confidence has slumped. Firms are struggling, too: French industrial production fell in February.The euro area\u2019s economy will probably still grow in 2022 as a whole. But it looks fragile. Should Europe stop importing Russian gas\u2014whether because it chooses to or the Kremlin decides to cut off the supply\u2014the danger of a recession will rise.The threat to global growth from  is the most severe and immediate. China reported over . Because the government is committed to eliminating covid-19, Shanghai\u2019s 26m residents, and those of other big cities with outbreaks, are under lockdown. If the past relationship between lockdowns and  holds, China\u2019s real-time output will be 7.1% lower than in a world with no restrictions, according to Goldman Sachs. Lockdowns will also disrupt global trade, which is still struggling with a hangover from earlier in the pandemic. Shanghai is the latest global port to see hundreds of ships back up offshore, waiting to load or unload.Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has urged officials to cut the costs of its restrictions. But if it opens up too soon, mainland China will see a wave of infection and deaths like that which recently plagued Hong Kong. That would scare consumers and become a source of economic disruption in its own right. Until China vaccinates its elderly in sufficient numbers using the most effective jabs, lockdowns will be an enduring feature of its economy and a source of global volatility.The blame for the world economy\u2019s many troubles lies squarely with policymakers. The Fed\u2019s job is supposed to be to take away the punchbowl just as the party gets going; it has instead presided over a blowout. Europe\u2019s governments let the continent become dependent on Russian natural gas. And China\u2019s difficulty in suppressing Omicron was predictable, and widely predicted. Economic trouble often strikes as a bolt from the blue. Today\u2019s recession scare was avoidable.

It promised that a chartered flight would soon leave France for Maputo, the Mozambican capital, carrying an unusual cargo: 7,427 bottles of wine. What did the email mean? When the public prosecutor asked about it at an ongoing trial, the younger Mr Guebuza shot back. \u201cDo you, madam, want some wine?\u201d he fumed, before alleging that the whole process is a political stitch-up. Lebanese businessman sent an email to Ndambi Guebuza, the son of Armando Guebuza, who was then president of Mozambique. It promised that a chartered flight would soon leave France for Maputo, the Mozambican capital, carrying an unusual cargo: 7,427 bottles of wine. What did the email mean? When the public prosecutor asked about it at an ongoing trial, the younger Mr Guebuza shot back. \u201cDo you, madam, want some wine?\u201d he fumed, before alleging that the whole process is a political stitch-up.Ndambi Guebuza is one of 19 high-profile defendants on trial in Maputo on charges including bribery, embezzlement and money-laundering (which they deny). The accusations relate to a series of deals in 2013 and 2014 which saw state-backed firms borrow more than $2bn, mostly in secret. Although the money was earmarked for fishing boats (pictured) and maritime security, American regulators say that at least $200m was pocketed by Mozambican officials and bankers from Credit Suisse, which helped arrange the deals. The revelation of the hidden debts in 2016 pushed the country into default and sparked court cases on three continents.One of those cases is the trial in Maputo, held in a marquee at a maximum-security prison and broadcast on national television. The hearing wrapped up last month, with a verdict expected in August. Between legal minutiae, it offered a lurid glimpse into the lives of Mozambique\u2019s super-rich, and allegations of how they splurged ill-gotten gains on posh flats and fleets of sports cars.In February the former president, Mr Guebuza, took the stand\u2014as a witness, not a defendant\u2014and used the opportunity to make a subtle dig at his successor, Filipe Nyusi. It was \u201cstrange\u201d, he said, that Mr Nyusi claimed to know nothing about how the corrupt deals were made, despite having been defence minister at the time. That is a sign of how politicised the issue has become, as rival factions jostle for influence within Frelimo, the ruling party. \u201cThose groups are fighting to control the party to be able to control the state and take advantage of it,\u201d says Edson Cortez, the director of the Centre for Public Integrity (), a Mozambican .Despite its internal ructions, Frelimo retains a strong grip on power and does not want its dirty laundry aired in public. Mozambique and America are still tussling over who can extradite Manuel Chang, the former finance minister who signed off the deals and currently sits in a South African jail. Activists say he would be more likely to spill the beans in an American courtroom than in his home country.It would not be the first American intervention. Three former Credit Suisse bankers who cooked up the loans have pleaded guilty to related charges in a New York courtroom. Last October the bank itself agreed to pay $475m to regulators in America and Britain for misleading investors and violating anti-corruption laws. The ruling said that the bank had ignored warning signs, including a due-diligence report which described the contractor who received the money as \u201can expert in kickbacks, bribery and corruption\u201d. , a Russian bank which was also involved in the deals, agreed to pay $6m to regulators.None of that money has gone to the people of Mozambique, although Credit Suisse has said it will waive $200m of the unpaid debt that it is trying to recover. That would be scant compensation for the crisis that the scandal caused. When the debts were revealed in 2016, donors halted aid to the government, the  packed its bags, the currency collapsed and growth slowed. A study by  and Chr. Michelsen Institute, a Norwegian research outfit, estimated that if these indirect effects are included, then the cumulative costs of the loans add up to nearly $11bn, almost as much as Mozambique\u2019s  in 2016.The debt itself is still outstanding. Some of it is now in the hands of investors who were not involved in corruption. Fiona Huntriss of Pallas Partners, a lawyer for some of them, says that \u201cinnocent lenders\u201d should be paid \u201cwhat is long overdue to them\u201d. The government of Mozambique counters that it should not have to pay because the state guarantees for the debts were issued illegally. That question will be settled in yet another court case, due to start in London next year, in which virtually every party to the matter is suing everyone else. The legal proceedings may rumble on, but justice remains elusive.

Since taking office in 2010 he has changed the constitution to benefit his party, nobbled the courts and seized control over most of the media. The  has chided his government for violating the rule of law, misusing its funds and fostering corruption. Mr Orban casts himself as an underdog defending his people against  bureaucrats, the international left and George Soros, a Hungarian-born Jewish philanthropist whom he accuses of plotting to flood Hungary with Muslim immigrants. \u201cWe have such a victory it can be seen from the moon, but it's sure that it can be seen from Brussels,\u201d Mr Orban crowed after the results were in.Also on his list of enemies is Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine\u2019s president. Mr Orban has long had friendly relations with Vladimir Putin, and claimed to be getting a discount on Russian gas. He has been the most reluctant member of the  and  coalition in the war in Ukraine, fiercely arguing against sanctions on Russian energy exports. In recent weeks Mr Zelensky has demanded that Mr Orban decide which side he is on. Mr Orban retorted that the opposition would drag Hungary into the war; they denied this, but many voters believed it. Government figures released after the election showed Hungary is actually paying Russia market rates for its gas.The opposition\u2019s defeat leaves in ruins its effort to build a coalition to stop the hollowing-out of Hungarian democracy. Because most s in Hungary are elected from single-member districts, smaller parties struggle to win seats. After years of defeats, in 2020 six parties, ranging from the nationalist right to the metropolitan left, joined forces in the United for Hungary umbrella grouping. They ran primaries to select candidates for parliament and for prime minister. Party leaders set aside their own ambitions to back Mr Marki-Zay, a conservative mayor who unexpectedly won the prime-ministerial primary.Now that coalition looks dead. Ferenc Gyurcsany, a former prime minister who leads the centrist Democratic Coalition party, seemed to question whether holding a primary had been a good idea. Peter Jakab, the leader of the hard-right Jobbik party, reproached Mr Marki-Zay for lacking a clear focus. Joining the centrist coalition was devastating for Jobbik, which lost most of its voters to Fidesz or to Our Homeland, a new nationalist party.A report from the , a European election watchdog, said the election lacked a level playing field. The main problem was not tampering, though there was some of that. There were reports across the country of \u201cchain voting\u201d, in which voters smuggle their ballots out of polling stations so that they can be filled in by party organisers and then given to other voters to submit, in exchange for payment. But the more important issues were media bias and government support for Fidesz. Mr Orban uses Hungary\u2019s state media as a propaganda megaphone, and most private outlets are controlled by oligarchs friendly to Fidesz. The opposition received little airtime, and what it got was overwhelmingly negative. It could spread its message only via a few independent news websites which most voters outside Budapest rarely read.Under Mr Orban, the billions of euros in aid which the  sends to Hungary each year have flowed largely to supporters of Fidesz. Hungary has the worst record of fraudulent use of  funds of any country in the union, according to , the \u2019s fraud-investigation agency. Mr Orban\u2019s friends and relatives have grown rich.

Within 200 seconds it had streaked across the Pakistani border. When it smacked to the ground just minutes later, it was 124km inside the territory of India\u2019s nuclear-armed enemy. Luckily no one was harmed. Lucky, too, that Pakistan did not respond to the intrusion, except to ask an embarrassed India what had gone wrong.The answer is still not clear, though India did say that there had been a regrettable mishap. What is known is that the wayward projectile was a BrahMos missile. Estimated to cost some $2m each and fired from land, sea or air, the nuclear-capable weapon is one of the most potent India possesses. It is also among the most visible products of a deep, decades-long partnership between state-run Indian and Russian arms-makers. Even its name, combining the Brahmaputra and Moskva rivers, suggests a , or confluence, of interests.This entanglement is one of the reasons why, seven weeks into Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, India finds itself in an uncomfortable position. The trouble is not just the sight of so much Russian armour, of exactly the sort that still makes up most of India\u2019s own arsenal, getting smoked on the plains around the Dnieper. It is also the attachment of the Indian state to a historic partner that could do something so capricious, destructive and stupid as to try to devour Ukraine.That has forced Indian diplomats into a marathon of fast talking and fancy footwork. The question they have struggled to answer is one that Joe Wilson, a Republican congressman from South Carolina and self-declared \u201cfriend of India\u201d, pressed on Lloyd Austin, America\u2019s defence secretary: how, he asked in a congressional hearing on April 5th, could a fellow democracy like India be persuaded to join its \u201cnatural allies\u201d in the West?Some Indian officials are blunt about the dilemma. \u201cWe know Putin is a shit,\u201d says one lawmaker from the ruling party, before explaining that reliance on critical Russian spare parts and technology limits room for manoeuvre in Delhi. Defending India\u2019s 11 successive abstentions in  forums since the invasion\u2014except for a strongly worded statement that \u201cunequivocally condemned\u201d the massacre of civilians in the suburbs of Kyiv\u2014others speak of a long tradition of non-alignment. They note that just as leaders in Delhi declined to condemn Russia, they similarly abstained from blasting America when it stomped into Iraq. Some more boldly say that Ukraine is Europe\u2019s problem, that India is simply asserting its own freedom to choose, and who says India belongs to the West anyway?India\u2019s Western suitors, keen not to alienate a country that is key to their own plans for managing China, have now muted their criticism of its position. Within India, the government\u2019s prickly resistance to what is portrayed as Western high-handedness and hypocrisy has been popular. For the time being, then, it looks like India may pay little price for breaking with the democratic pack over Ukraine. Indeed, it may profit from buying discounted Russian oil.Yet the self-congratulatory patter now echoing in Delhi\u2019s corridors of power, about having told bossy Westerners where to get off, may be premature. The Ukraine crisis has sent fawning envoys scurrying to India\u2019s capital. But it also reveals the country\u2019s underlying weaknesses. Dependence on imported arms is one of these. The BrahMos project, for example, is 24 years old. Most of its inputs are now Indian-made, but Russian parts remain crucial.Economic vulnerabilities, such as a near-total reliance on imported fossil fuels, have also come into sharp relief. Facing crucial state elections in February, India\u2019s government held down petrol prices from mid-December to mid-March. Now soaring back up to Ukraine-boosted global levels, they are causing a painful shock. No wonder those Russian oil discounts look so tempting.Josh Felman and Arvind Subramanian, a pair of economists, argue in a recent article that India\u2019s rulers may be fooling themselves into believing that the country\u2019s apparent military and economic heft translates to major-power status. In fact, an undersized domestic market for consumption and a small tax base with which to pay for defence upgrades mean that India remains a middling power in need of rapid, sustained economic growth. Their advice: India \u201cmust look past the illusion of size and reconcile itself with strategic realities\u201d.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/2022/04/09/indias-vaunted-strategic-autonomy-is-a-mirage", "date_modified": "2022-04-07T13:36:14Z", "date_published": "2022-04-09T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_asd001.jpg"},

Sitting in a caf\u00e9 on a shady street, Mahmoud, a software developer, runs through the new taxes and fees. A value-added tax () was introduced at 13% in 2016, then hiked to 14%. A few years ago the government added a tax of ten Egyptian pounds ($0.55) to Mahmoud\u2019s monthly phone bill. His cigarettes go up a pound or two whenever the treasury needs a puff of extra cash.

He says it has appreciated by $100,000 or so, a 25% increase. But his annual property-tax bill has remained almost flat, at less than 1% of the apartment\u2019s value.Arab countries have long lagged in collecting taxes. In 2015 the  estimated they raised the equivalent of 13% of non-oil , compared with 17% in other emerging markets. Christine Lagarde, then the fund\u2019s director, told an audience in Abu Dhabi in 2016 that Arab states should \u201cre-engineer their tax systems\u201d and boost revenue.They got the message\u2014up to a point. Since 2016 five Arab countries have brought in . Governments have imposed a spate of other levies on everything from mobile phones to cinema tickets and sought non-tax revenue by raising fees.If they are getting better at taxing their citizens, though, they are often taxing the wrong ones, imposing a big burden on those who can least afford it. Consumption (or indirect) taxes, such as , are highly efficient but generally regressive. They tax what you spend; the poor spend more of their income than the rich. In the , a club of mostly rich countries, indirect taxes raise about one-third of tax revenue. In recent decades the proportion has fallen.Arab states are going the opposite way (see chart). Egypt collected 46% of tax revenue from goods and services in the fiscal year 2020-21, up from 40% six years before. Indirect taxes are more than half the take in Tunisia, and three-quarters of it in Jordan, where they add up to 12-13% of .The appeal is simple. Value-added taxes raise a lot of cash without distorting economies much (which is why European welfare states love them). And outside the Gulf, most Arab countries have only a patchy picture of what their citizens do and how much they earn, which makes it hard to levy direct taxes. Some two-thirds of Egyptians work off the books in informal jobs. Less than half of Tunisians have bank accounts. The last time Lebanon conducted a census was in the 1930s. Tax inspectors are often overworked and reliant on pen and paper rather than databases. Evasion is widespread. A report in 2018 by Bank Audi, a Lebanese lender, estimated that it cost the exchequer $5bn a year (10% of  at the time).Authorities often blame this, wrongly, on the informal sector. Most Egyptians labouring in the black market should pay no income tax or a top marginal rate of just 2.5%. Even if the taxman found them all, the extra revenue would be meagre. The bigger problem is a tax system skewed towards the rich. Egypt\u2019s corporate-tax rate of 22.5% is five points below the African average, while its top income-tax bracket of 25% ranks as one of the continent\u2019s lowest. It also has no inheritance tax.Many rich and middle-class Arabs prefer buying property to shares, seeing it as safer and more lucrative. Yet governments collect little property tax. Jordan\u2019s finance ministry estimates that it brought in just 115m dinars ($162m) from property last year, just 1% of tax revenue.Some countries assess property tax on rental rates rather than the value of the building, which leads to puny bills. Egypt calculates these only once every five years, with increases capped at 30% per assessment, even though property values in some parts of Cairo rise by as much as 25% a year. Rich Egyptians who play the stockmarket are subject to a 10% capital-gains tax. But if they invest that money in property, the tax rate can drop below 1%.Oil-exporting Gulf states do not levy income tax, fearing it would upset citizens and make their countries less attractive to migrants. Corporate-tax rates are low, ranging from zero to 15%. Instead they, too, lean on consumption taxes. Saudi Arabia introduced a 5%  in 2018, then tripled it in 2020 (a move the  advised against). It will account for 79% of tax revenue this year. Poorer Saudis will be hit hardest. Rich ones tend to do their big-ticket spending outside the kingdom.Instead of making tax systems more progressive, Arab states are seeking ever more desperate ways to raise revenue. Last year a parliamentary committee in Egypt approved a 3% tax on purchases in duty-free stores (which may need a new name). Tunisia now charges people 100 millimes (3 cents) for paper receipts in shops. This is the fiscal equivalent of looking under the sofa cushions for spare change.Such measures will not make much of a dent in deficits, but may anger citizens. In 2019 the Lebanese government tried to put a 20-cents-a-day tax on WhatsApp calls. It became a trigger for mass protests that brought the government down.

Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, a former captain of the national cricket team, lost a no-confidence vote in parliament shortly after midnight on April 10th, ending his nearly four years in office. He had tried just about every trick in the book to cling to power, but was finally brought down by a combination of the opposition and the supreme court. His last day was a dramatic one. The court had earlier ruled that an attempt to block the vote was unlawful, and ordered that it go ahead as planned on April 9th. Yet for much of the day, Mr Khan\u2019s colleagues carried on trying to obstruct it. The speaker, an ally of Mr Khan, repeatedly held back the vote and adjourned the session three times. Government ministers filibustered and opposition fury grew. As midnight approached with no sign of a ballot, the supreme court prepared to sit and rule the speaker in contempt. With pressure building on them, the speaker and deputy speaker resigned. A former speaker presided over the vote. The government benches were deserted. When the votes were tallied, the opposition had 174\u2014two more than the simple majority they needed. Mr Khan now returns to opposition, where he has spent most of his political career. He does not plan to remain there for long. He has called for peaceful protests after evening prayer on April 10th. How many people turn out will give a hint of how much support he retains, and how much trouble he can make for his successor.Barring any upset, the next prime minister is almost certain to be a political dynast of the sort that Mr Khan once said he would drive out of Pakistani politics. Shehbaz Sharif, the younger brother of Mr Khan\u2019s predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, runs the main opposition party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of another former prime minister and head of the second-largest opposition group, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), has confirmed he wants Mr Sharif to have the job, for now at least.Mr Sharif, who is 70, lacks the charisma of his older brother, or indeed the crowd-pulling power of his niece, Maryam Nawaz Sharif. Instead his strength lies in a reputation as a competent administrator. The son of a wealthy industrialist, he went to university and worked in the family business before entering politics. While his brother had three terms as prime minister, Shehbaz had three terms as chief minister in the nation\u2019s most populous province, Punjab, where his administration spent heavily on infrastructure. His first stint was cut short by a military coup in 1999, when the army ousted the elder Sharif as prime minister and both brothers temporarily went into exile. Like his brother, he has also been accused of corruption. The Sharifs say the accusations are politically motivated. He is currently on bail in a money-laundering investigation. He denies wrongdoing.If he does indeed become prime minister, his reputation for competence will be tested. Pakistan\u2019s economy is in a mess. Inflation is a painful 13%, partly thanks to the war in Ukraine, and the rupee has been on the slide for months. A balance of payments crisis is looming.Mr Sharif will have learned from watching his brother that Pakistan\u2019s politicians can get in trouble if they bicker with the military. The elder Sharif and his daughter have railed against the generals and their meddling, but Shehbaz has been more conciliatory. The military is said to consider him the only acceptable candidate for the premiership from his party.Pakistan\u2019s foreign relations are fraught. The new government may need to patch up relations with Washington, which Mr Khan damaged by suggesting, without evidence, that Uncle Sam was behind the effort to push him out. America is used to being blamed for things in Pakistan, however, and the army has already made conciliatory noises. The PPP, which has got on better with America when it was in power in the past, will take a prominent role in the new government. So the damage Mr Khan did to bilateral ties will probably be short-lived.When it comes to dealing with Pakistan\u2019s immediate neighbours, Mr Sharif may have limited say. The generals have a lock on policy towards India and Afghanistan. General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the chief of the army staff, said on April 2nd that he wants talks with India and is ready to \u201cmove forward\u201d over Kashmir, a disputed region. The border between India and Pakistan is quiet after the arch-rivals agreed to stop taking potshots at each other in early 2021. Afghanistan, however, is a dangerous headache. The Taliban remain international pariahs despite Pakistani attempts to persuade the West to engage with them. The Taliban\u2019s victory last year\u2014when they overthrew an American-backed government the moment President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan\u2014has emboldened Pakistan\u2019s own jihadists, who have carried out more terrorist attacks. Pakistan has yet to recognise the Taliban regime formally, but probably has closer ties to it than any other country. Western powers alarmed by widespread hunger and human-rights abuses in Afghanistan see Pakistan as the best intermediary for dealing with the Taliban. But contacts so far have been limited, and Western sanctions on the Taliban remain severe. Shehbaz will also have to deal with Pakistan\u2019s \u201ciron brother\u201d, China. The Sharifs were instrumental in setting up the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor as part of Beijing\u2019s Belt and Road initiative to build infrastructure around the world. The brothers appeared to get on well with China\u2019s government. The initiative has slowed under Mr Khan and several key bits, such as a new railway, seem stalled. It is unclear if this is mismanagement, or if Pakistan got cold feet about the huge debts it was running up to pay for its shiny new port and power plants.Pakistan\u2019s new leader will not have an easy ride. His coalition may be unified in its moment of triumph, but that will probably prove fleeting. Mr Sharif\u2019s niece has for years been seen as the family\u2019s most appealing standard-bearer, and she may not want to remain in the back seat for long. Elections are pencilled in for late 2023, but could be brought forward. Pakistan\u2019s political drama continues.

{"title": "Can Silicon Valley still dominate global innovation?", "content": "TAKE AN EVENING walk on 17th Cross Road in Bengaluru\u2019s HSR Layout district, and you bump into tech types stepping out of their startup\u2019s office and into one of the local microbreweries. They might work for Udaan (e-commerce), Vedantu (education technology) or another of the growing herd of private startups valued at $1bn, whose proliferation in the area has prompted locals to dub it \u201cunicorn street\u201d. That name might be outdated, says Mohit Yadav, co-founder Bolt.Earth, a unicorn wannabe housed in the MyGate building. \u201cUnicorn neighbourhood\u201d would be more apt, he chuckles.HSR Layout was not always the startup hub of Bengaluru, itself the startup capital of India. Five years ago Koramangala, a few kilometres to the north, was the place to be\u2014until rising office prices pushed out new startups. The fact that young firms are beginning to eye an ever-wider region to set up shop hints that Bengaluru is maturing as a venue for ambitious technologists. The city is home to 26 unicorns, and last year attracted $13bn in venture capital (VC).For decades Silicon Valley\u2019s position as the birthplace of high-growth technology companies was unassailable. The small patch of land has given the world, among others, Hewlett-Packard (founded in Palo Alto in 1939), Intel (Mountain View, 1968), Apple (Los Altos, 1976), Google (Menlo Park, 1998) and Uber (San Francisco, 2009). Mark Zuckerberg moved in only four months after founding Facebook in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2004. As recently as 1999 the valley attracted a third of global VC investment. In 2011, 20 of the world\u2019s 27 unicorns had their headquarters in America, according to CB Insights, a data provider. Only four other countries boasted even one.Silicon Valley is still home to 136 unicorns, more than any other place in the world. But as Bengaluru shows, such clustering is no longer confined to a narrow strip of land in northern California (see chart 1). Unicorns can be found in 45 countries. Of the more than 1,000 that trot the globe, nearly half reside outside America. The share of all VC flowing into American startups has declined from 84% two decades ago to less than half (see map).The diffusion of capital beyond Silicon Valley in part reflects huge growth in tech in recent years that lifted many boats. But it will endure beyond the ups and downs of the investment cycle. Even as tech valuations slid during the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, the share of funds flowing to firms outside America has remained high at 51%.Of the places that have burst onto the startup scene, some are mature, such as Beijing, London or Tel Aviv, and often global in their ambition. Others, including Bengaluru, Singapore or S\u00e3o Paulo, are in earlier stages of hub-dom. All enjoy a broad pool of technical talent, deep links to other parts of the world and local risk capital. Together, they are redrawing the map of global innovation\u2014creating one that is more dispersed, diverse and competitive.Many of the new clusters look different to the original one in Silicon Valley\u2014although some share its pleasant climate. They also differ from each other. The more mature hubs tend to spawn more \u201cdeep tech\u201d firms working in complex areas like artificial intelligence and other sophisticated software aimed chiefly at corporate customers rather than consumers. But whereas Israeli and British startups often look across their countries borders, Beijing\u2019s are focused almost entirely on the domestic market.Younger innovation hubs, including Bengaluru, S\u00e3o Paulo and Singapore, look a bit more alike in that their focus is regional rather than global. Instead of breaking new ground they often adapt existing business models to local market conditions. As disposable incomes rise in new regions, consumers become willing to pay for similar \u201ctechnification of services\u201d, says Peng Ong of Monk\u2019s Hill Ventures, a Singaporean VC firm. Anand Daniel of Accel, a Silicon Valley VC firm, calls this the \u201cX of Y\u201d playbook. And so Flipkart (e-commerce) is the Amazon of India; Nubank (fintech) is the Revolut of Brazil; Grab (ride-hailing) is the Uber of South-East Asia. That helps explain why 70% of South-East Asian unicorns and 80% of Latin American ones are either in fintech or consumer internet (see chart 2). Still, hyper-localisation means each hub is distinct.The boom in tech clusters has been fuelled by several structural developments. The worldwide spread of high-speed internet and smartphones has allowed startups to serve customers just about everywhere from just about anywhere. \u201cRapid technology adoption has made the market so much deeper\u201d, says Abheek Anand of Sequoia India, the Indian arm of a Silicon Valley VC stalwart. Cloud computing and freely available developer tools have made starting a company much easier. At the same time, as growth rates in mature markets have slowed and competition for investments has risen, venture capitalists have started looking elsewhere for their next big bet.The pandemic appetite for all things digital has fuelled these trends. Some 60m South-East Asians, nearly a tenth of the region\u2019s population, became new netizens in the past two years alone, according to Bain, a consultancy. The number of companies in India and South-East Asia generating $100m of annual revenue has jumped by an order of magnitude in recent years, observes Mr Anand.If the democratisation of technology and global VC were the whole story, however, startups would be springing up everywhere. They aren\u2019t.  has looked at startup funding and valuation data for the ten countries with the most billion-dollar startups. We have found that nearly 40% of these unicorns herded in the country\u2019s top startup city. Between 2011 and 2021 the top city\u2019s share of national VC funding rose from less than 50% to nearly 70% for London, from 24% to 60% for Berlin and from 15% to 34% for Bengaluru (see chart 3).That suggests that clustering remains no less powerful a force than when Alfred Marshall coined the notion of \u201cagglomeration economies\u201d in the late 19th century. Once a city gains a foothold, additional activity is pulled in because of increasing returns to scale. It is easier to do business and recruit when suppliers and talent pools are nearby. Ideas flow more easily when employees from rival firms frequent the same pubs (or microbreweries). Even wide adoption of hybrid work is unlikely to change that; people will still want to meet in person and it is easier to do this when the persons are nearby.A deep talent pool is the most obvious ingredient of a successful cluster. Famously, Silicon Valley benefits from proximity to brain trusts such as Stanford or the University of California, Berkeley. Tel Aviv has both universities and recruiters from the Israeli Intelligence Corps, which like elite universities enlists the best and brightest. Participation in such elite units is an immediate signal for a venture capitalist looking for a startup founder to back, or a startup seeking to hire young technologists. Bengaluru has nearly 70 engineering colleges. More than 55% of Indians on LinkedIn, a professional social network, boast technical skills, such as those needed for programming. Only Germans are technically savvier, and merely by a whisker; for Americans and Britons the share is around 42%. \u201cWhere else can you quickly hire a few thousand engineers?\u201d marvels Shailesh Lakhani, a colleague of Mr Anand\u2019s at Sequoia India.Talent alone is not enough, however. Tokyo had the brains to produce global technology giants such as Sony (in electronics) and, more recently, Rakuten (in e-commerce). Yet the Japanese capital has struggled to nurture a vibrant startup scene. One possible reason is the continued dominance of Japan Inc by keiretsu (conglomerates). Another is the country\u2019s insularity. In one survey from 2019 the country ranked 53rd in the world in English proficiency; less than 8% of Japanese speak it fluently. Foreigners tend to have a hard time gaining status in Tokyo\u2019s business circles. Outside venture capitalists have been shunned.That hints at the second critical factor: openness to people and ideas. Migrants are a disproportionately enterprising bunch: you need a bold streak to move somewhere new. Around 60% of America\u2019s most valuable tech companies were started by immigrants or their children. European hubs such as Berlin, London and Paris, each of which is home to ten or more unicorns, have large immigrant populations. China lacks foreign founders but its startup hubs like Shanghai and Shenzhen draw plenty of \u201csea turtles\u201d, returnees who had studied or worked abroad. It is hard to determine to what extent connectedness spurs startup activity, as opposed to the other way around. But the two go hand in hand, and almost certainly feed off each other. Ren\u00e9 Belderbos of Maastricht University has examined how often inventors in a city co-author patents with inventors abroad, and how this changes over time. Unicorn-rich Bengaluru, San Francisco, Singapore and Tel Aviv all feature in the top ten of Mr Belderbos\u2019s ranking of cities based on the growth in such linkages. Unicorn-poor Tokyo has seen a decline in connections.Bengaluru illustrates how talent and openness combine to create startup magic. The city\u2019s fondness for newfangled technology dates back to at least 1905, when the local maharajah diverted a nearby supply of hydropower to make it the first city in Asia with electric streetlamps. Four years later it built the Indian Institute of Science, a prestigious university that remains a magnet for clever Indians to this day. Migrants make up more than half its population\u2014a statistic India\u2019s tech grandees invariably cite when explaining the city\u2019s success.It has also long been connected to the world. Texas Instruments, an American electronics-maker, chose Bengaluru for its first regional office in 1985. Infosys and Wipro, Indian information-technology (IT) giants based in Bengaluru since the 1980s, have served global software customers, making the city \u201cthe world\u2019s back office\u201d. When India\u2019s closed economy opened up in 1991, the city was the natural place for foreign companies and capital eyeing the country\u2019s vast market, says Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys. That in turn drew domestic ambitious domestic upstarts seeking connections and cash.Yet Bengaluru might not be where it is were it not for a third ingredient: the presence of local risk capital. For enterprise to thrive, it needs backers who understand the ecosystem and are willing to feed it. This can be founders and employees of earlier startups, who become angel investors for the next generation, notes Rana Yared of Balderton Capital, a VC firm. Former employees of Flipkart, which Walmart bought in 2018, have gone on to found 225 startups, including five unicorns, according to Tracxn, a data provider. Those from Grab, Lazada and Sea Group, a trio of Singaporean tech darlings, have founded or run more than 1,000 firms.A local capital base also encourages another important type of risk-taking. Employees must be able to leave existing firms and join or even start competing ones. AnnaLee Saxenian of Berkeley has argued that Boston\u2019s Route 128, also near to top-notch universities, was outcompeted by Silicon Valley in the 1980s because it lacked this free flow of people between firms, perhaps in part because of stricter enforcement of non-compete agreements than in California.In some cases, the state can step in to provide early backing. Besides having a long bench of angels that stretches back at least to Bill Hewlett and David Packard, Silicon Valley has enjoyed its share of government contracts in its formative post-war years, particularly from the Defence Department. Fairchild Semiconductor, whose employees included the future founders of Intel, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, depended on government procurement for much of its early growth. Bengaluru, home to military-research outfits, and Tel Aviv also have strong links to their countries\u2019 armed forces, which can act as buyers of first resort.Some governments support startups with capital rather than contracts. Take Singapore, which has more unicorns per person than anywhere bar Israel. Edwin Chow of Enterprise Singapore, a government agency in charge of the city-state\u2019s startup policy, puts this down to schemes aimed at attracting investors and founders. For instance, a big programme from 2009, modelled after a similar one in Israel, matched every $1 from investors with nearly $6 from the public purse. At least 15 funds qualified for the scheme, which allowed the investors to buy out the government\u2019s stake at its original face value.How much credit such top-down policies deserve is hotly debated. Historically, attempts to will clusters into existence have mostly foundered. Germany poured \u20ac1.5bn ($1.6bn) into a Bavarian cluster initiative in 1999. France funnelled a similar amount to its  in 2005. Malaysia\u2019s BioValley complex, launched the same year at a cost of $150m, was soon derided as \u201cValley of the BioGhosts\u201d. A Canadian experiment in supporting startups failed because it was so well-funded that private investors stayed on the sidelines. In 2009 Josh Lerner of Harvard Business School concluded that \u201cfor each effective government intervention, there have been dozens, even hundreds, of failures, where substantial public expenditures bore no fruit\u201d.Most investors and even some policymakers agree that Singapore\u2019s success has more to do with its entrepot status, pro-business laws and political stability. That said, the government\u2019s push may have been a spark that lit a well-oiled lamp. Justin Hall of Golden Gate Ventures, a Singaporean VC firm, reckons that the leg-up from the state may have accelerated Singapore\u2019s ascent by a few years.The importance of talent, openness and risk capital will persist. But the clusters that thrive thanks to a combination of the three will continue to evolve. As the younger clusters mature, the \u201cX of Y\u201d playbook will gradually give way to more advanced tech, as is happening in China. They will also become more globally minded. Already about 30% of India\u2019s current herd of 60-odd unicorns primarily target international markets, says Dev Khare of Lightspeed India Partners, one more VC firm.And new cities may join the ranks of tech hubs. Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s commercial capital, already looks poised to become the dominant player in the African fintech scene. In March Nigerian startups were better represented than those of any other country except two at Y Combinator, a famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator. Hot technologies such as the decentralised world of cryptocurrencies and so-called Web3 may seek out places with favourable regulations (or lack thereof). FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange valued at $32bn, has just moved to Nassau, in the Bahamas.

In the first round, fully 58% of voters backed a populist, nationalist or radical candidate on either the left or the right, far higher than in 2017. Turn-out, another measure of disillusion with politics, was slightly lower than at the previous vote, at about 74% compared to 78%. The first-round results also confirmed the upending of national party politics that has taken place since Mr Macron won power in 2017. Five years ago, the combined presidential score for the Socialists\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 candidates, representatives of the two political families that had traditionally held power under the Fifth Republic, was 26%. This time, it dropped to a catastrophic 6.5%. The two finalists, Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen, now have two weeks to persuade the French that they have what it takes to be the next president. Traditionally, the first-round vote is regarded as a moment to express a real preference. The French then treat the run-off vote as a moment to eliminate the least-appealing option. This can shift the dynamics, as voters are faced not with a hypothetical exercise but a hard choice. In 2017 a dramatic two-thirds of French voters decided that Ms Le Pen was the candidate to evict. Many of those who had no particular liking for the one-time investment banker and former economy minister in a Socialist government backed Mr Macron all the same in order to keep Ms Le Pen out.This time, polls say that fewer voters will follow that course. Indeed the narrowing of second-round polls suggests that it is Mr Macron whom many voters may want to dislodge. \u2019s polling average now suggests a final result of 52% for Mr Macron, and 48% for Ms Le Pen. Even a historically modest error in the polls would be enough to overturn the president\u2019s lead. Mr Macron\u2019s first-round lead over Ms Le Pen, of five points, gives him some momentum ahead of the run-off. In the second round Ms Le Pen is likely to draw support not only from Mr Zemmour, who shares much of her anti-immigration platform, but also, more surprisingly, from voters whose first choice was Mr M\u00e9lenchon on the left and Mrs P\u00e9cresse on the centre-right\u2014although Mrs P\u00e9cresse called on her supporters to back Mr Macron in the second round. Many of those who gave their vote to the Socialist or Green candidates in the first round may decide to stay at home or spoil their ballot paper, rather than vote for Mr Macron. Ms Le Pen has led a smart, grass-roots campaign, promising the French that she will cut the cost of living and the price of petrol at the pump, and posing for photos with children and animals. She has positioned herself as a calming, unifying leader for France, despite a programme that is anti-, pro-Russia, Eurosceptic and promises a policy of \u201cnational preference\u201d for the French when it comes to jobs and housing that would set her on a collision course with the European Union. Her manifesto includes pledges to ban the Muslim headscarf from public places (the face-covering niqab and the full-length burka have been banned in public since 2010) and end the automatic right to citizenship for those born in France. Yet Mr Zemmour\u2019s even more toxic far-right proclamations have ended up making her appear less extreme. Mr Macron, meanwhile, left it woefully late before launching his re-election campaign, on the ground that he was distracted by European affairs and his efforts to end Russia\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine. The sitting president has not spent nearly as much time as his rivals pressing the flesh, and his campaign has been flat, with nothing to show for his Russian efforts. Some of his manifesto promises, such as raising the pension age from 62 years to 65, are sensible but unpopular. Despite a decent track record managing covid-19 and bringing down unemployment, as well as revitalising the , Mr Macron has not managed to capture the national mood. The one and only debate between the two finalists, on April 20th, will be a crucial test of Ms Le Pen\u2019s ability to sound competent, and Mr Macron\u2019s ability not to sound condescending. Our model still makes Mr Macron the favourite, with a 74% probability of re-election compared with 26% for Ms Le Pen. But the mood in France is nervous and rebellious, and the sitting president will have his work cut out trying to win over voters on the disappointed left and centre-right. As he himself warned supporters at a recent rally outside Paris, there is no room for complacency. Reminding them about Brexit, he said darkly: \u201cWhat looked improbable can actually happen.\u201d ", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/10/emmanuel-macron-will-battle-marine-le-pen-for-the-french-presidency", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T17:34:29Z", "date_published": "2022-04-10T18:33:55Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220416_EUD001.jpg"},
{"title": "An ode to Tokyo\u2019s Nakagin Capsule Tower", "content": "THE NAKAGIN CAPSULE TOWER stands out from its unremarkable neighbours in Tokyo\u2019s Shimbashi district. Made up of 144 identical cuboids, stacked upon and jutting out from each other, the modular tower is both unabashedly futurist and subtly respectful of tradition. Each cuboid has a round window that evokes both space travel and the ancient architecture of Kyoto. They contain built-in living spaces composed of bath units, beds, desks and household electronics. Kurokawa Kisho, the building\u2019s architect, envisioned his cramped \u201ccapsules\u201d as dwellings for what he called Homo movens, or highly-mobile modern humans, such as the businessmen who lived in distant suburbs and worked late in Tokyo offices.When the tower first went up in 1972, it became a prime example of Metabolism, an influential architectural movement in post-war Japan. Metabolism\u2019s chief exponents had studied under Tange Kenzo, an architect whose works included the park and memorial built in Hiroshima to commemorate the nuclear attack of 1945. The Metabolists designed buildings to be adaptable and replaceable, and resilient to threats such as wars and earthquakes.The Metabolists sought to shift thinking about architecture from the mechanical to the biological, conceiving of cities as organisms that grew and changed rather than as static constructions to be planned and maintained. \u201cWe regard human society as a vital process, a continuous development from atom to nebula,\u201d they declared in their first manifesto, written ahead of the World Design Conference in Tokyo in 1960. Their ideas were informed both by Western modernism and Eastern philosophy, drawing particular inspiration from Japan\u2019s Ise shrine, which has been entirely reconstructed almost every 20 years since the 7th century.Metabolism also embodied the energy of Japan\u2019s rapid-growth era. The Metabolists did more than simply design buildings: in their hands, architecture became a field for reimagining Japanese identity after the ravages of the war. In theoretical texts, the architects pondered the relationship between technology and humanity. They considered the demands of designing cities for an expanding urban population and a humming economy. They presented visions of structures that floated over the seas and reached for the skies. Kurokawa called his capsules \u201ccyborg architecture\u201d, wherein \u201cman, machine and space build a new organic body which transcends confrontation\u201d.The ideas were characteristic of an era of change and possibility. \u201cIt was a period when society was bolder and could afford to do such things,\u201d says Maeda Tatsuyuki of Nakagin Capsule Tower Preservation and Restoration Project.This week the Nakagin tower will be torn down, following a long but ultimately futile battle to preserve it. The structure is neglected and riddled with asbestos. Many of the capsules are no longer habitable. The tower\u2019s destruction serves as a reminder of the relative caution and stasis of contemporary Japan. \u201cThese days, nobody would dare to build anything like that,\u201d Mr Maeda sighs. \u201cOur streets are becoming increasingly dull and boring.\u201dIt is also, ironically, reflective of the same culture of impermanence that once inspired the Metabolists. In Japan, buildings are traditionally made of wood and paper, not intended to last centuries. There is not much of a preservationist movement. \u201cJapan seems to demolish things before there\u2019s even debate,\u201d says Mr Maeda.Still, fans and residents of the Nakagin tower had hoped to raise funds to replace the capsules, in line with Kurokawa\u2019s initial concept. They had been in negotiations about buying the building. But the pandemic halted any momentum they had. Mr Maeda\u2019s group now hopes to rescue some 40 individual capsules, remove the asbestos, recreate the interiors and give them new lives at museums around the world. Mr Maeda compares the process to a \u201cwithered dandelion\u201d spreading its seeds. \u201cThe capsules will take on a life of their own, scattered across different locations.\u201d It is in keeping with the spirit of metabolism.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/asia/an-ode-to-tokyos-nakagin-capsule-tower/21808712", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T15:55:04Z", "date_published": "2022-04-11T00:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220416_asp503.jpg"},
{"title": "What happens if America\u2019s Supreme Court overturns women\u2019s right to abortion", "content": "A WOMAN IN Missouri who decides to end her pregnancy has a choice, of sorts. She can go to the state\u2019s last remaining abortion clinic, in St Louis, where state law dictates she must be told that \u201cthe life of each human being begins at conception\u201d and warned of the psychological damage the termination could cause. She must then wait 72 hours before returning. Or she can travel 15 miles (24km) east, across the Mississippi River, to a larger clinic in Fairview Heights, Illinois, where the doctor (it may even be the same one) can speak to her patient as she thinks best. The abortion can be done that day.This gulf between two neighbouring states illustrates the mess that surrounds abortion in America. Since 1973, when the Supreme Court ruled in  that abortion was a constitutional right, lawmakers in conservative states have introduced hundreds of regulations designed to make it hard for abortion clinics to function. Missouri is one of six states with only one clinic left. The mess may be about to get much worse. How likely is the Supreme Court to ditch ? At first, it seemed its conservative majority might use the case to lower the gestational limit on abortion on demand. The court had done this before: in 1992 it lowered that set by  (26 weeks) to fetal viability (around 23 weeks). Though abortion-rights activists rail against lowering the limit, it would change little: the vast majority of abortions happen in the first 12 weeks. It would also reflect popular opinion. Though many states impose stringent restrictions, America has one of the most liberal frameworks in the world: of 59 countries that allow abortion on demand, it is one of only seven that allow it after 20 weeks. Polls suggest most Americans\u2019 support for abortion drops dramatically after the first trimester. But abortion-rights groups are increasingly concerned that the court will scrap  altogether. In September Texas banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and the court failed to stop it. That seemed to express five justices\u2019 belief that  is not worth upholding.Then in December the conservative justices made this plain. During oral arguments in the Mississippi case, Brett Kavanaugh, one of Donald Trump\u2019s three nominees, cited many occasions when the court had overturned earlier decisions and suggested it should be \u201cneutral\u201d on an issue about which the constitution says nothing. Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at Florida State University, says that because introducing a new gestational limit would make it harder for the court to overturn  later, the likeliest alternative, \u201cwould be to do something more modest, such as saying viability is the wrong line and the right line could be decided in future cases\u201d. The question, she says, is whether  will be reversed \u201cgradually or immediately\u201d.A gradual reversal could come about if the court undermined the viability standard. Anti-abortion states could pass all sorts of bans and expect that the courts would be more likely to uphold them. In the event of an outright reversal, the impact would be immediate. Twelve states have \u201ctrigger laws\u201d that would click into effect the moment  was undone; a further 12 are expected to dust off pre- bans or make new ones. Congress is unlikely to provide a remedy. how this would play out. On September 1st, the first day clinics in America\u2019s second-most-populous state were forced to turn away patients, those in nearby states saw a sudden influx. Kristina Tocce, medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains in Denver, Colorado, says she saw a 1,650% increase in the number of patients from Texas in the 45 days to mid-January compared with the same period last year. \u201cIf  is overturned I fear Texas is a prologue to absolute chaos and confusion,\u201d she says.When Sara (not her real name) drove from Texas into Oklahoma, having distributed her seven children among several sitters, and stayed in a hotel, it cost her half her monthly income. Groups which help women with such costs say they have been flooded with requests. Anna Rupani, the director of Fund Texas Choice, says donors have been quick to step up, but she worries about what will happen if a lot more cash is suddenly needed.Even before the Texan law, clinics in states with decent abortion provision had become used to serving women far from home. This has helped them prepare for the demise of . In Illinois, Planned Parenthood, the biggest supplier of abortions in America, has been readying itself for years. The clinic in Fairview Heights was built in 2019 to handle growing numbers of abortion refugees from nearby states. Planned Parenthood has also built clinics on the Illinois borders of Indiana and Wisconsin, two of five neighbouring states that are likely to ban abortion if  goes.In January the Fairview Heights clinic and another one nearby opened a regional logistics centre to deal with the expected surge in non-clinical workload: arranging transport, hotels and funding for the many more women who were expected to arrive. Colleen McNicholas, Planned Parenthood\u2019s chief medical officer in the region, says staff are preparing to put in longer days and work seven days a week instead of six.Where pregnant women go, anti-abortionists follow. Local armies have moved their campaigns from states like Missouri, where the battle largely has been won, into Illinois. As patients drive into the Fairview Heights clinic they pass a large gallows from which the image of a fetus is hanging. Parked trucks, operated by an anti-abortion group, try to entice pregnant women into conversation by offering \u201cfree on board\u201d ultrasounds and pregnancy testing; posters advertise \u201cabortion pill reversal\u201d. At Planned Parenthood\u2019s clinic in Missouri, by contrast, it is quiet: a couple of softly spoken protesters wait with leaflets encouraging women to have their babies; the only ones they saw, one recent morning, were there for contraception.Elsewhere, smaller abortion providers are weighing their options. Tammi Kromenaker, director of the Red River abortion clinic in Fargo, North Dakota, the only one in that state, says she is often asked why she doesn\u2019t move a few miles east into Minnesota, where abortion will remain legal if  is overturned. She is torn, she says, between practicality and principle (\u201cour community needs us to be here\u201d), adding that in no other field of health care would providers face such uncertainty.This points to another example of American exceptionalism. Elsewhere, abortion tends to be embedded in broader health-care systems. In America it is practised almost exclusively in standalone clinics, largely so that providers can avoid the costly billing systems found in hospitals. Yet it has made the job of anti-abortion campaigners easier, allowing them to find the right women to shout at and to portray abortion as being separate and different. Partly as a result, clinics have become powerful defenders of abortion rights, including in the courts. When they close, says Carole Joffe, a professor at the Bixby Centre for Global Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco, \u201chuge political clout and grassroots support for the rights of women is lost\u201d. Several clinics in Texas, she says, are close to shuttering.As great as the post- upheaval is likely to be, it would be greater still but for three mitigating factors. First, it is not just the likes of Planned Parenthood that have been making preparations. A handful of states have scrapped all regulations on when or for what reason a woman may have an abortion. In California, lawmakers are expected to consider a plan to make the state a \u201csanctuary\u201d for anyone seeking an abortion.Second, the abortion rate today is half what it was in 1980. That is mostly down to improved access to more effective methods of contraception. It may also be linked to better sex education, especially in states that used to teach only abstinence (although Shannon Brewer, the director of Mississippi\u2019s last abortion clinic in Jackson, the capital, raises her eyebrows exaggeratedly when asked whether young patients lack basic knowledge about reproduction).A third element is the increasing use of abortion medication, which has transformed abortion care globally (because tracking it is hard it may also make America\u2019s abortion rate look lower than it really is). By taking two drugs several hours apart, women are able to abort at home without a clinic appointment. The pills can be posted after an online consultation. Several telemedicine startups now offer the pills more cheaply than clinics do. The drugs are also available illegally from Aid Access, a charity in Europe, and from online pharmacies overseas. Their efficacy and safety up until 11 weeks of pregnancy mean America should not return to an era of back-street abortions.Anti-abortion lawmakers are onto that. Last year, 15 states introduced bills restricting medication abortion. If  is overturned more will surely follow. Even if women can get hold of the pills, they could still be in trouble. The cramping and heavy bleeding they cause prompt some women to seek medical help. Some abortion providers suggest they tell doctors they are having a miscarriage if necessary. They worry that such women\u2014or doctors who have helped them\u2014may be charged with a crime.Some women\u2014those who wish to keep their abortion secret from their parents or partner, say, or those whose pregnancy has passed 11 weeks\u2014will continue to need care in an abortion clinic. And the number of those needing abortions later in pregnancy will grow if women have to travel farther, with the time-consuming burdens that entails. Thus the number who fail to have an abortion altogether will also increase. Using data from a nationwide longitudinal study that investigated the effects of either having an abortion or being turned away, researchers found that women who were denied abortions experienced a sharp spike in financial hardship. Their children suffered. Some obstetricians worry that overturning  could push up America\u2019s maternal and infant mortality rates.Democrats are ready to use such fears to try to boost turnout in the mid-terms. This may work among some educated women in suburbs where many of the competitive Senate races will be decided. In some close races their votes could be decisive. But whether it would prevent Republicans from taking the House and Senate is far from clear. In Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race last year, Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, repeatedly castigated Texas\u2019s new law. But he lost to Glenn Youngkin, his Republican rival who has supported abortion restrictions. Exit polls revealed, as they have done before, that abortion is a bigger voting issue for Republicans. Overall, however, abortion is some way behind a raft of other issues in voters\u2019 minds. The end of  may not necessarily prompt huge protests. \u201cThe only thing we know for sure is that it will be a mess,\u201c says Dr Joffe of the USCF Bixby Centre, \u201cand that rich women will do better than poor women.

{"title": "What will it cost to rebuild Ukraine?", "content": "WHEN THE war ended, the country resembled a wasteland. Almost all industrial structures had been flattened by air raids, infrastructure rendered unusable and large cities bombed out. Russian-led forces occupied the east, with millions fleeing their brutality. But West Germany\u2019s economy recovered strongly after 1945, in what would soon be coined the  (economic miracle).Unlike Nazi Germany, Ukraine is not the aggressor, and may yet be victorious. Nonetheless, rebuilding will be a monumental task. Vladimir Putin\u2019s war has so far claimed the lives of thousands of innocents and displaced millions; it has laid waste to houses and hospitals, bridges and ports. With no end to the hostilities in sight, more destruction will surely follow. Officials and economists are assessing the damage and, drawing on lessons from Germany and elsewhere, thinking about how to manage the eventual recovery.Researchers from the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), a network of economists, put the total cost of rebuilding Ukraine in the region of \u20ac200bn-500bn ($220bn-540bn), roughly in line with the government\u2019s own calculations. The way in which reconstruction happens, and the reforms that accompany it, will be just as important as the money spent. Done well, it could transform an economy that was once captured by oligarchic interests into something more open and dynamic.Working out the hit to the Ukrainian economy from war is a difficult business. The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (WIIW), a think-tank, reckons that the affected regions together make up about 29% of Ukrainian output. Electricity consumption, a proxy for activity, is down by around a third compared with a year ago. According to a survey by the central bank, 30% of firms around the country have stopped producing entirely and another 45% have reduced their output. The World Bank reckons that GDP will contract by 45% this year.The government is trying to limit the damage where it can. Aid from the West, of around $7bn so far, has kept the public finances afloat. Farmers have been given 20bn hryvnia ($675m) so that they can continue to work their fields. Manufacturers can apply for help to relocate within Ukraine. With Russia blockading Ukraine\u2019s main export route through the Black Sea, the government is working with the EU to make trading by land easier. It says that 80% of exports can still leave the country.Even so, rebuilding war-torn regions will come with a hefty price-tag. Three main tasks lie ahead. One is clearing affected areas of landmines and other explosive debris. Although the full extent of contamination is far from clear, past experience gives a sense of the costs involved. Before this war Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry put the cost of de-mining the Donbas region, which was invaded by Russia in 2014, at \u20ac650m. A de-mining effort on the scale of Iraq\u2019s would cost roughly $1bn over a decade. The economic benefits of de-mining could be large. Mozambique was once heavily mined; a recent study estimates that the boost from de-mining it, which took well over two decades, came to about 20% of GDP.Food and shelter will be a bigger expense. As a producer of grains and other agricultural commodities, Ukraine will probably be able to feed those in need. But the number of internally displaced people will continue to rise: at the time of writing it stood at 7.1m (a further 4.5m have fled the country). A tracker put together by the Kyiv School of Economics puts the value of destroyed housing at $29bn.A bigger-ticket item still is rebuilding damaged infrastructure and industrial facilities. The Kyiv School reckons that the destruction to everything from power plants and factories to bridges and roads so far exceeds $50bn (see chart 1). But lost production, a lack of maintenance and missing investment mean that even the infrastructure that is still standing will need upgrading. Another study by WIIW finds that, after the invasion of Donbas in 2014, such depreciation made up 60% of war-related infrastructure losses by the end of 2019. The prime minister\u2019s estimate of a cost of $119bn to infrastructure and industry this time may therefore not be far off.Reconstruction will require a plan, finance and a process for allocating money to projects. Ukraine\u2019s government has set up a recovery fund, and ministries are putting forward proposals for what needs rebuilding. With the finance ministry losing revenues of about $2bn a month, some money will be needed to prop up the public finances. Reconstruction will only add to the strain. The government, which is already highly indebted, may prove unable to borrow or repay its loans. A combination of debt relief and grants seems likely to be needed.Funding will have to come from Western governments, international organisations and private investors. (A proposal to use frozen Russian assets has been floated, but seems unlikely unless decided as part of a peace settlement.) Grant funding, especially from the EU, is not unheard of: Poland, with a population similar in size to Ukraine\u2019s, received \u20ac106bn in agricultural and investment funds between 2014 and 2020. Financing for private businesses could take the form of subsidised loans, such as from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). It has invested about $18bn in Ukraine over the years.The next question is allocating the money, a tricky task in an economy that has long been dominated by vested interests. Ukraine has made its process for tenders more competitive since 2014, but the contracts this time will be much larger. The CEPR suggests the use of framework agreements\u2014standing contracts with firms to deliver a certain product for a fixed price\u2014and open contracts that, even without tenders, ensure transparency.The final stage of rebuilding Ukraine will involve helping its economy flourish over the long term. In 2019 GDP per person, in real terms, was lower than it was at the fall of the Soviet Union\u2014a damning testament to the long-standing lack of reform in the country. Many of Ukraine\u2019s 1,500 functioning state-owned enterprises are lossmaking or barely profitable. Even before the war the IMF had urged the government to strengthen its anti-corruption framework and the rule of law.Ukrainians\u2019 political support for difficult reforms and their scrutiny of the post-war investment process will be crucial to make reconstruction a success. It might help that the government seems to see the process as an opportunity to make the economy more modern and competitive (and its industrial sector greener).Reconstructions of the past, meanwhile, suggest that success could also come from closer integration with Europe, as happened with West Germany decades ago. Poland\u2019s rapid growth is also often attributed to integration: in the 15 years after it joined the EU, its GDP per person increased by more than 80%.Ukraine had already been turning westwards. The share of its exports going to the EU rose from roughly 30% in 2014 to 36% in 2020, while the share going to Russia fell from 18% to 5.5% (see chart 2). One way to encourage reforms would be to make them a requirement for further integration into European markets and supply chains\u2014say, through a path to EU membership. \u201cThe beauty of accession is that it would create consensus within Ukraine about the endpoint of a painful reform process and lock in the direction of the reforms,\u201d argues Beata Javorcik of the EBRD.None of this will be easy. Reforming entrenched institutions requires political will. The longer the war continues, the more damage is wrought upon Ukraine, and the harder the task of reconstruction becomes. Nor will any amount of spending ever make up for the horrors of war. Yet careful planning could, at least, ensure a brighter, richer future.", "url": "https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/11/what-will-it-cost-to-rebuild-ukraine", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T23:06:33Z", "date_published": "2022-04-11T04:00:00Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2022/04/articles/main/20220409_fnp508.jpg"},

Another dozen died from suffocation in a basement in the local school. They were locked in there, along with the entire village, as human shields to protect a massive Russian army camp above ground during the whole period. Olga Martienko mops up tears with a pink scarf as she recalls the experience. She is 57, but looks a great deal older. There were 370 people sheltering in the school basement (pictured), she says; the youngest was a month old. Four to each square metre, the neighbours slept standing against one another, breathing in the same increasingly putrid air, and relieving themselves in the same bucket at the top of the stairs. On some days they were allowed out to breathe some fresh air; but on others they were not. \u201cAlmost as soon as the bombing started, people started hallucinating,\u201d Mrs Martienko says. For significant periods, the villagers were forced to cohabit with corpses in the basement, as the most frail passed away and there was no way of taking the bodies out. Ms Martienko\u2019s spot was at the entrance to the cellar. She was first to face Russian soldiers when they dropped by with their regular inspections. She braced herself whenever she saw torchlights under the cracks of the basement door. Some of them whispered words of horror at the conditions, she says. Others came in drunk, and asked why she was so old; they wanted young girls for sex, they said. One rotation tried to make them sing the Russian national anthem; the villagers refused, and they recollect this moment of solidarity with laughter and with pride. \u201cWe counted the days right up until they left,\u201d says Ms Martienko. \u201cIt was like being born again when we saw they had gone.\u201d The Russians  on the night of March 30th, bolting the door and ordering Yahidne\u2019s residents not to leave the basement until morning. In their rush, the soldiers left behind equipment and stark insights into their primitive ways. Cigarettes, bottles, human waste and stolen clothes\u2014bras included\u2014still litter their dugouts and sleeping quarters in the school\u2019s ground floors. Outside the school, just beyond six white body bags, is a crate of military propaganda. The \u201cmilitary patriotic preparedness\u201d boxes were apparently used to explain to the soldiers why they were fighting in Ukraine: teaching aids sketch key dates of glorious Russian history and the Russian military oath; a map shows most of Ukraine as historic Russia. Another crate contains reading materials: a book of the Dalai Lama\u2019s teachings, and a magazine from Tuva, the Buddhist region of southern Russia where some of the units came from. The villagers say that the Tuvan soldiers were the most cruel of all\u2014especially when they started drinking. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t handle their alcohol and didn\u2019t understand us,\u201d says Natalya Cherepenko, a small-scale farmer. \u201cWe did our best to avoid any contact with them.\u201d The Tuvans lived away from the school, commandeering the villagers\u2019 ramshackle but proudly kept huts in five parallel streets. Those streets were no-go areas without an armed escort, says Mrs Cherepenko. Ethnic Russian soldiers, generally more \u201cunderstanding\u201d of the Ukrainian villagers, would occasionally offer that protection, allowing the villagers to their homes to collect a change of clothes and medicines. They even kept guard as Mrs Cherepenko milked her cows, which she was allowed to do once a day. \u201cOne of the young lads kept saying sorry to me. He said he was from Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, that he thought he would be doing military exercises, and that his mum had no idea he was in Ukraine.\u201d The villagers tell stories of soldiers and commanders making ethical choices inside a lawless military structure that expected nothing of them. One type of soldier killed and ransacked their homes, they say, stealing expensive laptop computers, alcohol, chickens, and everything else they could lay their hands on. But another category went out of their way to make life easier for the villagers, allowing them out when commanders weren\u2019t looking. They were the ones who brought water, and doctors to them during nights of the worst bombardment. \u201cOf course, we all understood we were human shields locked in a basement at their pleasure,\u201d says Nadezhda Tereshchenko, \u201cbut they told us they were taking responsibility for our safety while we were there, and I think there is some truth to that.\u201d Halyna, a villager whose missing brother-in-law was found buried with gunshot wounds to his head, is less charitable. She says the majority of the soldiers belonged to a third category: oblivious to the destruction they were creating, yet arrogant enough to believe they were doing God\u2019s work. \u201cThe most upsetting thing was seeing them bring you water, and thinking they were doing you a good deed,\u201d she says, \u201cwhile you realise they are wearing your kid\u2019s brand new trainers.\u201d", "url": "https://www.economist.com/europe/2022/04/11/a-ukrainian-village-tries-to-make-sense-of-russian-occupation", "date_modified": "2022-04-11T10:03:38Z", "date_published": "2022-04-11T10:03:21Z", "id": 1, "image_src": "https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/media-assets/image/20220416_BLP501.jpg"},
{"title": "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine is under new management", "content": "AS THE RUSSIAN invasion of Ukraine stalled in February and March, Western officials scoured the intelligence to work out who was in charge. No one, it seemed. Russia had attacked Ukraine from several axes in the north, east and south. Each of those forces was fighting\u2014and in some cases, losing\u2014its own war.

Who is he?  invasion of Ukraine stalled in February and March, Western officials scoured the intelligence to work out who was in charge. No one, it seemed. Russia had attacked Ukraine from several axes in the north, east and south. Each of those forces was fighting\u2014and in some cases, losing\u2014its own war. As Russia  on Kyiv for now and focuses instead on the Donbas region and the rest of eastern Ukraine, it is learning from its mistakes. On April 8th a Western official told  and other news organisations that General Alexander Dvornikov, commander of Russia\u2019s southern military district, had been put in charge of operations in Ukraine. Who is he? General Dvornikov was born in Ussuriysk, a city near the Chinese border in Russia\u2019s far east, in 1961. He graduated from the local military school as a teenager and rose through the ranks in what was then called Russia\u2019s Far Eastern military district, whose main task was to guard against Chinese attack. Like Vladimir Putin, Russia\u2019s president, he served in East Germany, leaving with the last Russian forces in 1994. He also fought in the exceptionally brutal second Chechen war at the turn of the millennium. \u201cHe accomplished everything smoothly and with hard work, was never anyone\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and moved up the ranks with great difficulty,\u201d a military source told Russian state media in 2016. He was later appointed deputy commander of the Eastern district and then chief of staff of the Central one, which has responsibility for Central Asia.That led to a career-making posting. In 2015 General Dvornikov became the first commander of Russia\u2019s military campaign in support of Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2019s dictator. The idea of a small but decisive projection of military power a long way beyond the country\u2019s borders, using air, ground and naval forces, was a novelty for Russia. \u201cThe Syrian armed forces had completely exhausted themselves, the personnel were demoralised [and] the officer corps was degraded,\u201d recalled General Dvornikov, years later. Russian involvement \u201cradically changed the situation\u201d. His success in turning the situation around and rescuing Mr Assad\u2019s regime earned him the Kremlin\u2019s approbation: in 2016 he was made a Hero of the Russian Federation, the country\u2019s highest honour. He also bagged an appointment as commander of the Southern military district. The district is small, but strategic: it abuts Donbas, where Russian forces and their proxies have fought Ukraine since 2014, and where the next phase of the current war is likely to play out. It was this command, and his consequent knowledge of the area, that probably led to his appointment as the point man for Ukraine. That command also put him on a British sanctions list: he is alleged to have overseen air support for a Russian attack on Ukrainian naval vessels in 2018, which helped Russia consolidate its occupation of Crimea. More troubling still was the conduct of the forces he commanded in Syria. During his first three months in charge, Russian air strikes were estimated to have killed almost 700 members of Islamic State, a jihadist group\u2014but almost 800 civilians, too. Human-rights bodies accuse Russia of using cluster munitions in built-up areas and deliberately striking hospitals around Aleppo, a rebel-held city. In 2020 Human Rights Watch, an , cited General Dvornikov\u2019s Hero of the Russian Federation award as evidence of the \u201clack of accountability\u201d in Russia\u2019s war. Heavy civilian casualties were an inevitable byproduct of the strategy General Dvornikov adopted in Syria. In an article published in 2018, he pointed to the difficulty of fighting in mountains, in tunnels under cities and night operations. Firepower was key, he said: air strikes, missiles fired from warships, artillery and, in Aleppo, \u201cconstant fire\u2026day and night, without a break\u201d. Psychological warfare was important, too: \u201cwithout information operations, we would not have been successful in Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor and Ghouta,\u201d said General Dvornikov, referring to urban areas that were all but levelled. Ironically, given Russia\u2019s woes in Ukraine, the paramount lesson was the importance of unified command. General Dvornikov ran the war from Russia\u2019s headquarters in Khmeimim, an airbase in western Syria, with 15-20 staff. Khmeimim \u201clinked all the elements into a single reconnaissance and strike\u201d system, he noted later. Commanders could talk to one another by video link. Naval officers could co-ordinate strikes by aircraft-carriers against ground targets. Decisions were made quickly. General Dvornikov is not the only one with this experience. Almost every senior Russian officer has spent time in Syria. Alexander Zhuravlyov and Alexander Chayko, the generals who command Russia\u2019s Western and Eastern military districts respectively, have both commanded Syrian operations twice and have spent longer there than General Dvornikov, notes Rob Lee of King\u2019s College London. But General Dvornikov is \u201cvery thoughtful\u201d and \u201clistens to others, contrary to many Russian generals of his rank and generation\u201d, says a source who has met him. He is said to have impressed German officials during a visit to the country some years ago. A capacity to learn will be vital for Russia\u2019s armed forces. \u201cThe Kremlin identifies Syria as a highly successful\u2014and replicable\u2014operation,\u201d concluded a study published by the Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank, last year. That it was not replicated in Ukraine is probably down to several pathologies: the secrecy with which the Kremlin planned the war, faulty intelligence about Ukraine\u2019s fragility and its will to resist, and the vastly bigger scale of the operation.Yet the fragmented command structure will have played a role, too. \u201cThere is an expectation that their operations will be far better co-ordinated than they were previously,\u201d says the Western official. \u201cWe are yet to see evidence of that in terms of what they\u2019re doing, but\u2026we would expect command and control to improve.\u201d General Dvornikov cannot fix everything\u2014morale remains low, officials say, with some Russian units refusing to fight, and manpower is still an issue too\u2014but the coming weeks will show whether he can get the Russian war machine back on track.
